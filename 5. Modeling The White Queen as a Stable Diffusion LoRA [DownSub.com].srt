1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:07,259
嘿，下午好，为什么我们不一起做一个
hey good afternoon so why don't we do a

2
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:09,780
模组，这样你就可以
mod together just so that you get the

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,860
感受到我
feel for maybe the new uh way I'm kind

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,440
处理模型的新方式，然后
of working on models and then

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,140
看看我实际上是怎么做的，
see how actually I kind of do it and

6
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,240
然后看看你是否想要 采用我的一些
then see if you want to adopt some of my

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,140
方法，
methods

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,939
所以我想做的是重新审视一个旧的，一个
so what I want to do is revisit an old

9
00:00:28,939 --> 00:00:31,859
我已经
uh an older one I've kind of been

10
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:33,960
研究了一段时间的旧方法，看看我是否可以
working on a while and see if I can

11
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,719
改进它一点点，
improve on it a little bit

12
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,180
嗯，这基本上就是
um which is essentially the White Queen

13
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,520
我要的白皇后 我的一生都在努力，
I to my whole life kind of been working

14
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,440
就像
on like

15
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,579
几个月前一样，感觉已经很久了，但让我们
months ago it feels like ages but let's

16
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:49,680
看看我们如何尝试改进这
see how we could try to improve this

17
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,100
件事，让它实际上变得更好，嗯，
thing so that it actually is a better uh

18
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,239
更好的模型，
a better model

19
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,660
所以首先我要创建一个
so first thing I'm gonna go and create a

20
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,699
新文件夹 时不时地，我将
new folder here and then and I'm going

21
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:01,920
复制所有这些图像，以便我
to copy all of those image such that I

22
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,119
有一个我们可以编辑的工作副本，所以
have a working copy that we can edit so

23
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:08,040
我将创建一个新文件夹，我
I'm going to create a new folder I'm

24
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,960
将调用它
going to call that

25
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,619
可以图像 V2
can image V2

26
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:15,060
然后我是 要
and then I'm gonna

27
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,939
复制我在这里得到的所有这些图像，
copy all of those image that I've got

28
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:20,580
包括标题
here including the captions

29
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,040
我要将所有这些东西复制到
I'm going to copy all that stuff into

30
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,500
图像 YouTube 文件夹中，
the image YouTube folder

31
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,299
然后在该文件夹中我将
and within that folder I'm going to

32
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:29,159
创建另一个文件夹，我将
create another folder that I'm going to

33
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:31,439
调用新
call new

34
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,159
文件夹 我打算称之为
folder I'm going to call that

35
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:37,140
is

36
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,180
Raw
Raw

37
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,759
我将把所有这些图像拆分成
I'm going to split all of those image in

38
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,000
there

39
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,299
关于那是我的鸟的故事，它
story about that that's my bird that's

40
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:53,939
有点疯狂所以我不确定
kind of going nuts so I'm not sure if

41
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:55,740
你是否能在录音中听到它但
you can hear it on the recording but

42
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,780
也许是 你想知道那是什么 那是
maybe so if you wonder what that was

43
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,600
我的小鹦鹉 它在
that's my little parrot that's kind of

44
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,659
楼下咯咯地叫
uh squawking down downstairs

45
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:06,240
所以我有所有这些图像
so uh so I've got all those image so

46
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,818
所以我们有一个观点让我们把它们
just so we have a view let's bring them

47
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:11,819
带上来 你真正想做的一件事
up and one thing that you really want to

48
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:14,040
呃 当你有 像那样的图像和
do uh when you have image like that and

49
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,080
我学到的一件事我学到了很多是你
one thing I've I've learned a lot is you

50
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,020
真的需要专注于主题所以
really need to focus on the subject so

51
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:23,160
摆脱任何不是呃
get rid of anything that does not uh

52
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,500
那不是主题并且会
that is not the subject and that will

53
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,420
丢掉学习的东西所以我们要
throw the learning away so we're gonna

54
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,319
必须去编辑所有这些图像以
have to go and edit all those image to

55
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:32,819
稍微清理它们所以
kind of clean them up a little bit so

56
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,800
我要在这里启动 Photoshop
I'm going to fire up Photoshop here and

57
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,200
我要带来第一张图像是的
I'm going to bring the first image

58
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,180
我们需要做一些
and yeah we're going to need to do some

59
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,800
裁剪 为了控制这个主要主题，
cropping just to keep that main subject

60
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,840
所以我们要
in check so we're just going to go and

61
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,300
删除很多内容，
remove a lot of the content

62
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,760
是的，我的分辨率不是很好，我
and yeah my resolution is not so great I

63
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,980
看到我会像一些 sub
see that I'm gonna have like some sub

64
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:57,660
500 和 512 x 512 分辨率
500 and 512 by 512 resolution

65
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,440
um

66
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,360
嗯是的 那会很棒，但
yeah that's that's going to be great but

67
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,980
我想我们只是在
I guess we're just going to go with what

68
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,379
某个时候使用我们现有的东西，现在你必须使用
we've got sometime now you've got to use

69
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:06,540
你所拥有的东西，这将
what you've got this one is going to be

70
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,840
再次变得相当小，
like fairly small again

71
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,519
肯定是一些我不会的东西' 不
definitely some what I wouldn't

72
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,080
建议像你不想做
recommend like you don't want to go

73
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,019
任何小于 512 x 512 的东西，否则
anything less than 512 by 512 otherwise

74
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:17,459
你会遇到麻烦，但
you get into trouble

75
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:19,440
我想在这种情况下我会有
but I guess in this case I'm gonna have

76
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,659
很多选择，
much choice

77
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:24,480
我会继续编辑那个，
and I'm Gonna Keep Going edit that one

78
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,480
所以请检查一下 我们只是添加
so bring it in check so we just add the

79
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,840
主题 Focus 因为那是
subject Focus because that's where the

80
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,040
学习将要发生的地方，
learning is going to take place right

81
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,140
保留所有这些东西是没有意义的
there's no point in keeping all of that

82
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,480
因为那不是我们
stuff around because that's not what we

83
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,280
想要学习的我只想了解
want to learn I just want to learn about

84
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,459
一个主题而不是其他所以我' 我
the one subject and nothing else so I'm

85
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:43,620
只是继续前进，即使
just going to keep going and even though

86
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,220
它们很小，它仍然会
those are quite small it will still add

87
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,959
为模型添加有价值的信息，它们
valuable information to the model they

88
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,360
只是在训练过程中学习的更小的
will just be smaller kind of learned

89
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,099
部分，
parts

90
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:55,379
during the training

91
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:57,720
所以我们将保留我们将
so we're going to keep the hands we're

92
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,060
要使用的手 空气的背面
going to go with the back of the air and

93
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:04,280
听起来不错让我们保留那个
that sounds good let's keep that one

94
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:06,959
我要继续并保持手
I'm gonna go ahead and keep the hand

95
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,340
在这里
here

96
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,760
只是砍掉左右不相关的东西
just chop what's not relevant on the

97
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,680
所以我只是快速
left and right so I'm just quickly going

98
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,260
通过这里
through here

99
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:18,919
保持手
keeping the hands

100
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,440
砍疯帽匠 有点在这个
chopping the Mad Hatter sort of in the

101
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,740
过程中，
process

102
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,680
如果那个模型结果很好，我
and if that model turns out good I'm

103
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,780
会把它发布在
going to publish it on

104
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:40,280
civit AI 上，所以
civit AI so

105
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,400
现在我有一大堆
now I've got a whole bunch of image that

106
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,780
重复的图像，所以可能会证明
are repetitive so that could prove like

107
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:55,259
部分有问题，它可能会
partially problematic it might

108
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:58,139
像学习过程一样触发 可能
trigger like the learning process might

109
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:00,419
会歪斜所以这个很软但是
get skewed so this one is quite soft but

110
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:03,600
哦好吧我们可以尝试看看我们是否可以
oh well we can try to see if we can fix

111
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,600
通过某种方式修复它所以这个所以这个
it in some ways so this this so this one

112
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,460
所以现在我要展示其中
so now I'm kind of going to show like

113
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,199
一些
some of those are pretty much well

114
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:12,360
裁剪得很好 这个需要一些非常
cropped this one needs some very

115
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,620
裁剪，而
cropping

116
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,400
不是我所说的完全腐败的
not what I would call perfectly corrupt

117
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,360
主题，
subject

118
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,400
我们只是去关注
we're just going to go and focus on the

119
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,419
这里的一个主题，
one subject here

120
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:25,800
让我们
make that

121
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,419
继续
going

122
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:29,580
看图像的其余部分，
kind of looking at the rest of the image

123
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:33,060
他们再次非常腐败，只是
they are pretty well corrupt again just

124
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,759
看看那些 那些有一个裁剪
looking at those ones there's a cropping

125
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,639
我可以进一步裁剪那个
I could crop that one a little further

126
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,979
所以我们摆脱不是那样
so we get rid of not that way

127
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,940
保存这个
save this one

128
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,280
以裁剪这个
to crop this one

129
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,580
很好我想我们有肉汤不错它
well I guess we have broth not bad it

130
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,680
可能只是底部有太多东西
might just there's too much stuff at the

131
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,660
直到我们可以删除
bottom here until we can remove there is

132
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,419
模型没有什么可学的，所以
nothing to learn there for the model so

133
00:05:57,419 --> 00:05:59,940
这甚至不会浪费那些像素我正在
that's not even waste those pixels I'm

134
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:03,479
学习无关紧要的东西
learning stuff that doesn't matter

135
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:06,060
呃快速经历
uh quickly going through

136
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,860
快速增长好吧让我
quickly growing through well let me

137
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,300
暂停视频我要去
pause the video and I'm gonna go and

138
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,280
修改所有这些 然后我们再次成为它
modify all of them and then we're again

139
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,220
完成的原因
the reason when it's done

140
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,979
所以我几乎所有的
okay so I've got pretty much all of the

141
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:19,919
图像都按照我想要的方式损坏所以我们
image corrupt the way I want so we have

142
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,680
喜欢周围正确构图的
like properly framed

143
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,620
主题
subject all around

144
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,319
所以我在这个阶段可能想做的
so what I might want to do at this stage

145
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,220
是尝试 看看我是否可以
is try to see if I can improve

146
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:34,380
稍微改善这些图像以获得
these image a little bit to get like

147
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,840
更干净的面孔，因为其中一些有
cleaner faces because some of them have

148
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,460
一些
kind of

149
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:42,660
嘈杂的面孔，但不是很好 有时它们
noisy not so great Faces Sometimes they

150
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:46,800
有点模糊
are kind of a little bit uh blurry and

151
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,900
等等，让我们看看我们是否不能
whatnot so let's see if we could not

152
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,520
改善那又怎样 我要做的是
improve that so what I'm going to do is

153
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,660
我要在这里复制这张
I'm going to copy here the path to this

154
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,840
图片的路径，然后我将一个一个地进入自动模式
image and I'm going to go into Auto one

155
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,080
one one

156
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,880
，我将进入附加功能，
and I'm going to go under the extras and

157
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,440
我将进入批次模式 从
I'm going to go under batch from

158
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,319
目录中加载我的
directory and I'm going to load my

159
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:09,960
文件夹我将把
folder here I'm going to put

160
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,020
第二个作为 Gan 将
the second one as Gan so I'm going to

161
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,479
process all of those image and just for

162
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:18,660
a good measure I'm going to resize all

163
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,000
它们的分辨率也加倍，
of them to double their resolution as

164
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,620
所以我们将
well so we're gonna double up the

165
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,360
每张图像的分辨率加倍，然后我
resolution of each image and then I'm

166
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,699
将对每张调整大小的图像运行完整的 gan
going to run a full gan

167
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:29,880
呃清理
uh clean up on each of these resized

168
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,580
以尝试提高面部质量
image to try to improve the quality of

169
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,660
the faces

170
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,599
所以我们不显示 结果，但
so let's not show the results but for

171
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:39,360
现在我们只是要去，
now we're just gonna go and

172
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,080
嗯，
um

173
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,440
对所有图像都这样做，这是
do that for all of the image now the one

174
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,500
我将要处理的一个问题，这是一个
issue that I'm gonna have and that's a

175
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,440
挑战，过程如何进行，
challenge with how the process goes and

176
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,940
也许我不会这样做，因为
maybe I'm not going to do it because of

177
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,819
我所有的图像都被重述了，
that all of my image are all recaptioned

178
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:56,940
我有很短的标题，上面
where I've got like very short captions

179
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,500
写着白皇后，你知道
that says the White Queen you know what

180
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,240
我们可能会放弃它，
maybe we're just going to ditch that and

181
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,440
我们只是
we're just going to go with something

182
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,500
为这个演示做一些基本的事情所以 让我们甚至不
basic for this demo so let's not even

183
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,419
关心我得到的那些字幕，
care about those captions that I've got

184
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,520
因为它们是超级基本的，本质上只是
because they are super basic just

185
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,199
主题的名称，
essentially it's the name of the subject

186
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:13,139
有时
and sometime when there's uh

187
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:15,360
甚至在这种情况下也没有，就像有时我
not even in this case like sometimes I

188
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,580
有它，就像是否有皇冠一样
had had it like if there was a crown or

189
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,099
但是 让我们什至不理会它
not but let's not even bother with that

190
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:23,280
所以让我们跳过让我们忘记
so let's just skip that let's forget

191
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,039
它并且让我们运行这个呃
about it and let's kind of run this uh

192
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:30,000
放大并清理实际的
upscaling and clean up of the actual

193
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,560
面孔让我们看看会发生什么所以现在
faces and let's see what happens so now

194
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,779
如果我去这里应该有
if I go here there should be

195
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:36,779
一个应该显示的新文件夹 当
a new folder that should show up when

196
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:38,760
Gan 开始正常运行时，
Gan starts to run

197
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,380
all right

198
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:43,700
它正在生成，
so it's generating

199
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,860
所以它应该显示为两个原始图像，所以
so it should show up as image two raw so

200
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,240
它应该在这里，
it should be in here

201
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,940
现在我们应该开始看到图像
and now we should start to see the image

202
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,899
作为清理后的图像出现，如果我们看
coming up as cleaned up image if we look

203
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:58,080
它们，也许脸是
at them maybe the face is a little bit

204
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,899
这里有点太干净了，我们并没有丢失
too clean here there's not we've lost a

205
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:02,820
很多面部细节，所以也许
lot of the details of the face so maybe

206
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:06,120
这有点太强了，
this is a little too strong

207
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,120
只是有点太强了，但有时它
just a tad too strong but sometimes it

208
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,399
可以帮助学习整个模型，
could help learning the whole model

209
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:13,260
因为现在图像少了很多
because now the image is a lot less

210
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,940
嘈杂，
noisy

211
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,820
呃，你知道我们要做什么，
uh you know what we're going to go with

212
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,279
我们要用那种
that we're going to go with that kind of

213
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:22,380
力量去清洁面部
a strength of cleaning up of the face

214
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,120
，也许结果会很好，
and maybe it's going to turn out good

215
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,980
也许不会那么好，
maybe it's not going to be so good and

216
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,320
我们” 你将需要再次用较低的重做它，
we're going to need to redo it with

217
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,420
但
lower again but

218
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,880
它让你知道你可以做些什么来
it gives you an idea of what you can do

219
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,760
清理面部，所以你可以从
to clean up faces so you can go from

220
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,740
看起来让我们看看我是否可以带来
as looking let's see if I can bring like

221
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:42,420
一张简短的实际之前的脸，让我们
a face that's a brief pre-actual uh

222
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,800
看看 以
let's look at

223
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,380
这个为例，
this one for example

224
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,360
这就是清理前的样子
so that's what it looks like before the

225
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,580
，让我们带来
cleanup and let's bring what it looks

226
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,920
清理后的样子，因为无论如何我都必须
like after the cleanup because I've got

227
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,860
等待它完成，
to wait anyway for it to complete

228
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:59,279
所以这是清理后的新版本
so this is the new version after a

229
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,560
，这是升级后的版本
cleanup and this is the upscaling and

230
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,019
这是清理和放大之前的版本，
this is the version before clean up and

231
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:05,820
所以你可以看到
upscaling so you can see that there's a

232
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,459
lot less

233
00:10:07,459 --> 00:10:10,740
它可能对我们不利的瑕疵少了很多，
blemishes it might be working against us

234
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,440
但它确实在头发中添加了很多细节
but it does add a lot of details in the

235
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,600
并且很好地放大了一些东西所以
hair and scaling up things quite well so

236
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,600
它应该有助于学习
it should help with the learning of the

237
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,500
实际的劳拉，
actual Laura

238
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,640
所以是的，这是我过去
so yeah so that's a process I used to

239
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:27,080
实际上
actually get a better picture

240
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,600
通过放大然后用
for training by just upscaling and then

241
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,700
cleaning them up with the

242
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,580
我想用 gan 清理它们来获得更好的训练图片的过程
I guess with gan

243
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,560
所以我要暂停，直到我们
so I'm going to pause until we have all

244
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,940
清理了所有图像并且 我不会
the image cleaned up and I'm not going

245
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,680
继续，这样我就不会让你
to resume so that I don't get you to

246
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,700
浪费时间看油漆干了
waste your time watching paint dry

247
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,940
好吧感谢编辑的魔力现在
okay thanks to the magic of editing now

248
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,700
所有的图片都已经放大所以
all the pictures have been upscaled so

249
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,500
下一步是检查所有
the next step is to go through all of

250
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,540
这些并确保 没有
them and make sure there's no bad

251
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,700
我们想要丢弃的坏照片，所以让我们
pictures that we want to discard so

252
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,560
一张一张地看它们，一个
let's go and look them one by one that

253
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,040
很好，一个很酷，很好，一个很好，嗯，
one's fine that one's cool that's fine

254
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,760
好的，好的，很好，很好，很好，很好，很好，
that one is okay uh okay okay yeah

255
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,399
that's good that's good

256
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,920
fine fine

257
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,220
很好，
okay good good that one sort of view

258
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,100
从 后面这个有点
from the back this one is kind of uh

259
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,440
模糊不太好所以让我们
blurry all around not good so let's

260
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,760
删除它
delete it

261
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:25,440
嗯那会很好很好很好你看到
uh that would be good good good you see

262
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,360
后面没关系
the back that's okay it's always good to

263
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,980
听到一个主题总是很好
have you heard a subject that one is

264
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,779
sort of

265
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:33,959
我不知道让我们 删除它呃
yeah I don't know let's delete it uh

266
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:36,540
这个更好更好好吧
this one is better better

267
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,160
okay

268
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,720
好吧你能预订所有好的那个
okay can you book all good that one's a

269
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,640
从后面看的风景
view from the back

270
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,779
嗯
um

271
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:47,820
我想我不知道它增加了很多
I guess I don't know that it adds much

272
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,920
所以让我们删除它
so let's delete it

273
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,519
uh

274
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,140
呃是的那个不是很好我认为
yeah that one's not very good I think

275
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:01,200
脸不 看起来不太好 呃
the face doesn't look good uh it's kind

276
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,500
从后面看有点模糊 没关系
of blurry view from the back that's okay

277
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,500
okay

278
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:10,860
look good look good look good

279
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,200
yeah yeah

280
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,540
that one not so great so I still need it

281
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:19,980
好吧 看起来不错
that one's okay okay okay okay okay

282
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:23,160
and that's it now let's make sure there

283
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:27,300
没有任何问题，就像我注意到的那样，
is no issues with any like I've noticed

284
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,160
当它有点升级时，我
when it was kind of upscaling that I've

285
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,680
得到了这样的图像，例如，它是
got like this one for example is kind of

286
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,260
另一个图像的反转图像，所以这个
a reverse image of the other one so this

287
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:37,339
图像
one is sort of

288
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,740
是它还是不是它是反转的 我
is it or is it not is it reverse I'm

289
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,720
看到了锅碗瓢盆，我看到了一些
seeing pots and pans and I'm seeing kind

290
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,279
相同的东西，
of the same

291
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:45,899
所有的一切，它看起来像
and all and everything it looks like

292
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:48,060
这个，就像一个反转的图像，也许
this one is like a reverse image maybe

293
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,980
当是的，也许
when the

294
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,260
它就像反转一样，
yeah maybe it's just like the reversal

295
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,880
让我们​​删除其中一个，我
let's delete one of them which one do I

296
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,459
想要哪个 为了保留，我认为我有很多
want to keep I think I've got plenty of

297
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:58,560
面孔，但侧面较少，所以我要
face but fewer of the side so I'm going

298
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,480
删除那个，
to delete that one

299
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,660
呃，任何其他跳跃的东西，
uh anything else that kind of jumps this

300
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:06,300
我认为这很好，它们是
one I think is fine those are two sides

301
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,700
同一个人的两个侧面，所以她有点 旋转
of the same person so she kind of spun

302
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,220
一下，这样没关系，
around so that's okay

303
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,279
嗯，我认为其他一切看起来都还
uh I think everything else looks

304
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,019
不错，所以我认为我们
okay-ish so I think we're pretty much

305
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:17,940
对这个数据集非常满意，它会给
good with this data set which would give

306
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,320
我们大约
us about

307
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,560
30 47 个图像，
30 47 image

308
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,399
嗯，
um

309
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:26,519
这不是完美的数字 48
which is not the perfect number 48 would

310
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:29,940
会更好，因为它更多 一个可被
have been better because it's more of a

311
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:34,260
4 整除的数字 呃，也许
a divisible number by four uh what maybe

312
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,300
我们需要修剪一些，以便我们
we need to trim a few just so that we

313
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,279
得到一个可以被 4 整除的数字，
get to a number that can be divisible by

314
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:41,700
例如 44
4 like 44 for example

315
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,519
嗯，所以让我们尝试减少三个图像
um so let's try to cut down three image

316
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:46,740
，我们有很多重复
and we have quite a bit of repetitions

317
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:49,560
在这个系列中，所以也许我们可以在那里剪掉其中一个，
in this series so maybe we can cut one

318
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,360
of them there

319
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,100
所以这个看起来不一样，这个
so this one is looking different this

320
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:57,740
非常严重，所以也许我们剪掉了，
one is serious serious so maybe we cut

321
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,720
也许我们剪掉了，
maybe we cut

322
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,000
我不知道这个或那个
I don't know this one or that one

323
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,700
让我们剪掉这个，
let's cut this one

324
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:12,180
现在我们要 [
now we're down to 46. uh what else could

325
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,600
we remove

326
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,100
think that

327
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,639
we could probably do away with maybe one

328
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,740
of those

329
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,560
one does not much value

330
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,079
there's no face presence so let's delete

331
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,240
that one

332
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,139
um

333
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:35,160
now we need to cut one more which is

334
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,880
going to get cut

335
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,079
音乐]  ]
[Music]

336
00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:48,839
是的，我们几乎有一个双倍的，
yeah here we almost have like a double

337
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:51,120
所以看起来它们是不同的，但它们
so it looks like they are different but

338
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,860
是双倍的，所以这个她
they are doubled so this one she's got

339
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,620
闭上了眼睛这个，
the eyes closed this one

340
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:56,699
嗯，
um

341
00:14:56,699 --> 00:14:58,680
我认为这个是正确的一面，
I think this one is the right side this

342
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,060
这个是错误的一面，所以我要走了
one is the wrong side so I'm going to

343
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,680
剪切错误的侧面图像好吧，现在我们已经
cut the wrong side image okay now we're

344
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,079
下降到 44。我们在一个好地方
down to 44. we're in a good place

345
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,500
好吧，所以现在我们
okay so now that that's done what we

346
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,660
需要做的是，即使我们
need to do is even though we could

347
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,760
可能不带标题也可以取消，我
probably do away without caption what I

348
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,740
想做的是标题 图像
want to do is caption the image such

349
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:16,019
使得我们有一些
that we have like

350
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:19,019
东西会说出一个独特的
something that's going to say a unique

351
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:21,240
关键字，而不是白皇后，因为
keyword like not the White Queen because

352
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,480
它在稳定的传播中是众所周知的，
it's kind of known within a stable

353
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,160
所以我宁愿使用
diffusion so I would rather use more

354
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,240
更像一个梦幻靴子令牌，它是独一无二的，
like a dream boot token that is unique

355
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,699
就像来自 名字
like just the few letters from the name

356
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:34,920
，然后是一些
and then something that also gonna go

357
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:39,360
我们希望呃
and describe things that we want the uh

358
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,339
系统忘记的东西，比如在这种
system to sort of forget like in this

359
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:43,860
情况下，她戴着她的王冠，她没有
case she's wearing her crown she's not

360
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,540
戴她的王冠，所以我想做的
wearing her crown so what I want to do

361
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,240
是把王冠当作一个可选的东西，
is have the crown like an optional thing

362
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,240
所以我 我要在舞会上告诉 stable diffusion
so I'm going to tell stable diffusion in

363
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,940
她在这张照片上戴着皇冠，
a prom that she's wearing a crown on

364
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,620
而在这张照片中我不
this picture and in this one I'm not

365
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,060
打算说明，因为她
going to State it because she doesn't

366
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,199
没有皇冠
have a crown

367
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:00,540
我还看到有一些图像
I also see that there is some image

368
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:03,240
她拿着一个 剑 所以我要
where she's holding a sword so I'm going

369
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,000
在那些图片的字幕中加上
to put sword in those captions for those

370
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,639
剑 我要在
ones and I'm gonna put swords in uh

371
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,199
没有剑的地方放剑
where there's no swords I'm just going

372
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:13,199
to go ahead and do a quick captioning of

373
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,839
each image and then we're going to get

374
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,480
当它通过编辑的魔力完成时回来
back when it's done through the magic of

375
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,899
editing

376
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,339
哦
oh

377
00:16:22,339 --> 00:16:26,519
为什么我不告诉你我
why don't I show you uh that how I

378
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:29,760
实际上是如何做一个快速字幕
actually go and do a quick captioning

379
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,699
我将使用 Koya SS GUI 我将
I'm going to use Koya SS GUI I'm gonna

380
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:34,740
进入实用程序并且我' 我只是
go under the utilities and I'm just

381
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:38,399
要进入呃基本字幕我
gonna go under uh basic captioning I'm

382
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,100
要放入包含图像的实际文件夹，
gonna put the actual folder that

383
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,560
在
contains the image which would be in

384
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:47,100
这种情况下是地毯罐文件夹
this case the rug can folder

385
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,019
我要复制
I'm going to copy that

386
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:53,000
我要去这里把它放到
I'm going to go here put that into

387
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,000
这里的部分所以 我想获取文本文件
section here so I want to get text file

388
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,160
我想覆盖任何现有的
I want to overwrite any existing

389
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,720
说明文字，因为我需要做
captions because I'm going to need to do

390
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,519
一些事情，所以首先我
a couple things so first thing I'm going

391
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:05,339
要为每张图片加上白皇后的说明文字，
to go and caption each image with

392
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:14,880
the White Queen so t h e w h i t e q u

393
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,600
e

394
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:20,400
这样白皇后就
so the White Queen

395
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,540
这样了 这应该可以解决白
so so that should do the trick the White

396
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:27,059
皇后的问题，好吧，所以我要用它作为
Queen okay so I'm going to use that as

397
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:28,860
标题文本，所以我要为
the caption text so I'm going to caption

398
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:31,260
每张图片加上标题，我要删除这里的任何内容，
each image I'm going to delete anything

399
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:35,039
这样就可以了，
here so by doing that it's going and

400
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,100
它会创建一个
it's going to create a caption text file

401
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,679
包含第一个关键字的标题文本文件现在我
that contains that first keyword now I

402
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:42,240
注意到我应该放一个逗号
noticed that I should have put a comma

403
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,760
因为有逗号很好
because it's nice to have commas there's

404
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,500
当你学习模型时有一个很好的技巧
a nice trick when you learn the model

405
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,539
关于逗号所以我要做的
with about comma so what I'm going to do

406
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:50,160
是我要去 摆脱这个，我
is I'm going to get rid of this and I'm

407
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,200
要把它放到查找文本框中
going to put that into the find text box

408
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,500
，我想用
and I want to replace this with a the

409
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,299
末尾带逗号的白皇后替换它，所以
White Queen with the comma at the end so

410
00:17:57,299 --> 00:17:59,700
如果我点击标题，我会回到这里
if I hit caption and I come back here

411
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,440
，现在如果我打开一个 又一次
and now if I open one of them again

412
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,360
你会看到我们
you're going to see now that we have the

413
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,880
在末尾有逗号，这很好，
comma at the end which is good now with

414
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,620
我将不得不去手动
that I'm gonna have to go and manually

415
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:10,500
打开一个一个，呃，她
open one by one uh the ones where she

416
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,020
有皇冠的那些，所以现在我会去 在这张照片中，
has it Crown so now I would go in this

417
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,299
我要说的是皇冠类型，
one I'm going to say type crown

418
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:17,340
因为她在这张照片中有一顶皇冠
because she's got a crown in this

419
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,440
，我想把这个关键字添加
picture and I want to add that keyword

420
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,799
到她戴着它的每一张照片中，
to every picture where she is wearing it

421
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,500
所以我现在要保存这个我需要在
brown so I'm gonna save this now I need

422
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,360
技术上进入每一个 其中之一
to technically go in every one of them

423
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,880
并添加该关键字所以我要
and add that keyword so I'm going to

424
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,340
暂停它所以我要添加皇冠并且
pause this so I'm going to add crown and

425
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,440
我要添加剑到
I'm going to add sword to the ones that

426
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,059
我想要的那些然后这就是
I want and then that's going to be it

427
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:39,020
for the captioning

428
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,700
我认为看到的字幕 现在已经完成了字幕，
I think saw a captioning is done so now

429
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,380
如果你看这个，例如，
if you look at this one for example

430
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:46,380
我们有带剑的白皇后，
we've got the White Queen with the sword

431
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,360
如果我们看那个，我们有带
if we look at that one we've got the

432
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,340
皇冠的白皇后，所以这就是
white queen with the crown so this is

433
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,740
你如何完成所有的 字幕
how you get through all of the captions

434
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,260
呃，你有点列出了
uh and you're kind of listing the

435
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,660
每张图片的独特元素，这些元素
elements that are unique to it each

436
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,900
不属于该主题，
image that are not part of that subject

437
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,120
但实际上是
but that are actually kind of addition

438
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,179
它的补充，就像一把剑和一顶王冠，所以现在
to it like a sword and a crown so now

439
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:08,220
已经完成了，呃，我们需要什么
that that's done uh what do we need to

440
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,840
现在下一步我们需要继续并开始
do next now we need to go ahead and

441
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,480
配置我们将如何训练
start to configure how we're gonna train

442
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,059
这个东西所以如果我回到
this thing so if I go back to in image

443
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:17,340
这里的图像看到我们有两个文件夹
here see we do we have got two folders

444
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,140
四个
four

445
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,059
um

446
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:23,640
嗯 Koya 说要正确训练这些
uh Koya says to properly train on these

447
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,500
我们 需要有一个
ones we need to have a single folder

448
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,299
包含图像的文件夹，所以我将
that contains the image so I'm going to

449
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:28,980
在这里创建一个新文件夹，我将其
create a new one here that I'm going to

450
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,539
命名为
call

451
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:31,799
嗯，
um

452
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:33,780
我将其命名为什么，所以也许我
I'm going to call it what so maybe I

453
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:36,600
可以使用我正在使用的原始 Gan 文件夹
could just use the raw Gan folder I'm

454
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,100
只是要在其中创建子文件夹，
just going to create the subfolder

455
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,660
within it

456
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:42,960
鉴于图像的数量，我将重复 50 次，
and I'm going to do 50 repeats given the

457
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,940
也许 50 次就
number of image maybe 50 is going to be

458
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:47,700
足够了，所以重复 50 次，我将
good enough so 50 repeats and I'm gonna

459
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,919
输入
put

460
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:52,020
我们得到的关键字，以便我们
the keyword that we've got so that we

461
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:55,740
知道 这是关键字 所以 th
know that this is the keyword so th

462
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:59,039
h t
w h t

463
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,460
立方体
cubed

464
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:06,080
u-e-e-n 所以白皇后
u-e-e-n so the White Queen

465
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,660
我要去这里 选择所有
I'm gonna go down here select all the

466
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:12,419
文件并将所有这些文件移动到
files and move all those files inside

467
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,220
该文件夹​​中
that folder

468
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,340
所以现在我们有了它并且我们有了地图 我们
so now we have that and we have a map we

469
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,080
应该有一个匹配的
should have a matching

470
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:23,940
工具包 t h w h t q n excellent 所以
toolkit right t h w h t q n excellent so

471
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:26,220
让我们匹配它好吧，既然已经完成了，
let's match it okay now that that's done

472
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,960
我们可以复制
we can copy

473
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,460
this

474
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,080
这个文件夹名称，
this folder name

475
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,140
然后我们可以进入 Koya SS GUI 并
and then we can go into Koya SS GUI and

476
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,000
进入 dream boot Laura，我们
go under dream boot Laura and we're

477
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,200
将开始
gonna start

478
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,080
创造这个传说，所以我要做的第一件事
to create this lore so first thing I'm

479
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,840
做的是重用现有的参数我
gonna do is reuse existing parameters I

480
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,059
猜我刚刚
had for I guess the training I was just

481
00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:48,179
做的训练所以我将用
doing so I'm going to replace this with

482
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:52,080
我的图像路径替换它在这种情况下我做了
the path for my image in this case I did

483
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,640
一个设置白皇后图像 V2 rugan
a set the White Queen image V2 rugan

484
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,179
我只是要去 去复制
and I'm just going to go and copy and

485
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:02,940
你知道我想要什么我通常把劳拉
you know what I want I usually put Laura

486
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:05,160
放在那里因为我想区分
in there because I want to differentiate

487
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,799
劳拉和文本倒置的数据集
data sets for Laura and textual

488
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,840
我要去这里然后去
inversions I'm going to go here and just

489
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,820
修复我要
going to go and fix I'm going to fix

490
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,700
在这里修复我 我只是要去创建
that here I'm just going to go create

491
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:19,140
一个新文件夹 我要打电话给劳拉
a new folder I'm going to call Laura

492
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:22,020
我得把这个扔到那里
and I Gotta Throw This one there and

493
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:25,559
我要抓取我的
that's where I'm going to grab my

494
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:27,919
图像
image

495
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,919
所以回到这里替换它 所以现在
so going back here replacing that so now

496
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,260
我们有了劳拉 现在是什么 我能做的
we have the Laura and now what I can do

497
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,360
是我可以去替换我对项目
is I can go and replace all of my

498
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:39,780
文件夹的所有现有引用
existing reference to the folder

499
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:42,539
所以现在我们很好所以
for the project so now we're good so

500
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:44,700
我们接下来要做的实际上是
what we want to do next is actually

501
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:48,720
在稳定中创建一个文件夹我
create a folder in the stable where I'm

502
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,340
将把我的稳定 扩散
going to put my stable diffusion

503
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,320
学习，这将成为
learning that's so that's going to be

504
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,179
模型的输出，所以我将
the output for the model so I'm going to

505
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:55,320
其称为
call it

506
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,059
为什么
why

507
00:21:57,059 --> 00:21:58,620
Queen
Queen

508
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:01,080
和瓶子的名称将与
and the name of the bottle is going to

509
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:04,320
我们目前拥有的实际标记相匹配，
match the actual token that we have for

510
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,419
所以如果我回到这里，
the moment so if I go back here

511
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:07,260
呃
uh

512
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:10,679
选择 在这里，所以标记是
select this here so the token is

513
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:13,100
that

514
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:18,240
回到哦，是的，我要把它
going back to oh yeah I'm gonna put that

515
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,820
作为我的
as my

516
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:22,020
开场白，我要创建
opening and I'm going to create e

517
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,539
第一个电子版本，我要复制这个东西
version one I'm going to copy this thing

518
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:26,400
，我要把它作为我的
and I'm going to put that as my

519
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,980
配置 文件名所以我知道它是否
configuration file name so I knew it if

520
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,840
是配置文件，让我们保存它
this was to config and let's save it

521
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,600
让我们确保它确实保存了文件而
let's make sure it did save the file

522
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,679
没有任何错误所以我要
without any error so to do that I'm just

523
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:39,659
进去看看这是它
going to go in and see this is where it

524
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:41,580
说保存没有错误的地方 所以我们
said save there was no error so we're

525
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,860
很好地保存了
good with the saving

526
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:44,700
嗯
um

527
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,440
我想我真的不再需要
I guess I really don't really need a

528
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,840
在那里发表评论所以我们很好地
comment in there anymore so we're good

529
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,600
保存了那部分
with that that that that part is saved

530
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,340
我们现在有了配置
we have the configuration now the

531
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,659
参数这是
parameters this is where it's

532
00:22:54,659 --> 00:22:59,460
有趣的地方所以 我正在使用 呃 我
interesting right so I'm using uh I

533
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:02,580
想在这种情况下 44 的批量大小
guess in this case batch size of a 44 is

534
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,380
不会被 8 整除所以
not going to be divisible by eight so

535
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,480
这会导致一些问题 44
that's going to cause some issue 44

536
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:11,640
除以 8 等于 5.5 所以我说是的
divided by 8 equal 5.5 so I said yeah

537
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,340
嗯我想我会做四个我' 我打算
um I think I will just do four I'm going

538
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,980
做四批，这样 44 就可以被
to do batches of four so that 44 is

539
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,380
8 整除 4，
totally divisible by eight by four and

540
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,440
它会给出 11
it's going to give 11

541
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,539
基本上是 11 组四张图像，所以
essentially 11 groups of four image so

542
00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:28,140
我要训练批量大小为 4
I'm going to do train batch size of four

543
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:31,320
呃，我们要训练一个 Epoch 我们
uh we're gonna train for one Epoch we

544
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,600
有一个名为文本的字幕扩展名，
have a caption extension called the text

545
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,260
我们将在我的案例中使用我将
we're gonna do in my case I'm gonna do

546
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:40,679
混合 Precision BF 50 16 进行培训，
mix Precision BF 50 16 for the training

547
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:43,500
但我将保存在 fp16 中以
but I'm Gonna Save in fp16 for

548
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:47,039
与那里的用户兼容，
compatibility for users out there

549
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:50,220
嗯学习率这是我的东西 我
um learning rate this is something I'm

550
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,080
不会设置，因为我正在使用
not gonna set because I'm kind of using

551
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,220
一个特殊版本的 uh
a special version of uh the trainer that

552
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:59,940
我得到的训练器，它正在使用一种叫做
I've got which is using something called

553
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,380
uh
uh

554
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:06,179
all right 动态适应的东西，它
all right Dynamic adaptation which is

555
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:08,280
会为我计算学习率，
going to calculate the learning rate for

556
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,140
所以我不会去 现在必须指定
me so I'm not going to have to specify

557
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,580
学习权限的程度
the learning right degree right now

558
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:14,039
在那个版本中仍然有字段，
still has the fields when in that

559
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:15,659
但这没关系，因为
version but that's okay because that's

560
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:17,940
如果你要在没有动态适应的情况下进行训练，那将被忽略，
going to be ignored if you are to train

561
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:20,760
那么这些值
without Dynamic adaptation then those

562
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,919
将是很好的开始值，比如
would be good values to start like zero

563
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:26,820
零零零一个是 对训练有很好的价值，
zero zero one is a good value for

564
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:28,980
有趣的是，
training and interestingly enough most

565
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:31,140
大多数时候动态适应
of the time Dynamic adaptation kind of

566
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:34,620
接近这个值并且它保持
gets close to this value and it stays

567
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,539
在那里并且它提供了相当好的
there and it provides pretty good

568
00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:38,780
结果
results

569
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,280
嗯再次学习率调度器
um again that learning rate scheduler is

570
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,840
不会被使用它会被
not going to be used it's going to be

571
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,280
忽略
ignored

572
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,780
嗯我' 我不会迟到兑现，
um I'm not going to cash late and

573
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,220
因为我要向你展示
because I'm going to show you something

574
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,440
我在培训期间要做的事情，所以
that I'm gonna do during the training so

575
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,799
我将创建一个 128 级的 uh Laura
I'm going to create a 128 rank uh Laura

576
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,500
512 by 5 哲学解决方案我
512 by 5 philosophy solution I want

577
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,120
绝对想启用存储桶，因为
definitely to enable buckets because

578
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,000
我 我在高级配置侧令牌填充中得到了一个混合纵横比数据
I've got like a mixed aspect ratio data

579
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,440
集
set

580
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,220
um
um in the advanced config side

581
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:06,840
可以使用创建的
token padding that can use that created

582
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,299
累积步骤一个很好之前的
accumulation steps one that's fine prior

583
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:12,000
损失重量一个学习率
loss weight one learning rate number of

584
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,900
循环数我没有做多个呃时代
Cycles I'm not doing multiple uh epochs

585
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:19,860
所以不会 重要的是象征性的
so that doesn't matter keep in token

586
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:20,580
嗯
um

587
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:23,640
我想要我真的不想像
I want I don't really want to enforce

588
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,679
第一个看到的那样强制执行并且一直在
like the first to look and to be

589
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,299
开始所以我
at the beginning all the time so I don't

590
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:30,000
不在乎剪辑跳过我发现把它
care clip skip I found that leaving it

591
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,340
留给一个人对实际的人类
to one does better with actual human

592
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:35,520
角色更好 令牌长度是的 75 我们
characters token length yeah 75 we don't

593
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,100
不需要更改那个乱序的字幕，
need to change that shuffled captions

594
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,840
因为我有几个
because I've got like a couple of

595
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,480
字幕，
captions like where something that it's

596
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,240
就像它是
like it's kind of the word for the

597
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:49,320
主题和皇冠或剑的词，我要把
subject and Crown or sword I'm gonna

598
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,179
字幕这样洗牌 它们可以
Shuffle the caption such that they could

599
00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:52,740
颠倒它们可以以不同的
be reversed they can come in different

600
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:55,620
顺序出现所以这是一个很好的做法我
orders so that's a good practice I'm

601
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:58,320
会做我不再使用 8 位空闲
gonna do I'm not using 8-bit idle

602
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,820
因为我发现它给出的
anymore because I find that it gives

603
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:02,220
结果比你实际上
worse result than when you actually

604
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,799
不使用它时更糟糕所以我 我要花点时间
don't use it so I'm taking a bit out and

605
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,799
使用 x formers 是的颜色增强
out use x formers yes color augmentation

606
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:10,200
没有翻转增强不因为它是一个
no flip augmentation no because it's a

607
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,900
人，翻转会有点
human and flipping will kind of enforce

608
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:15,539
像奇怪的人工制品一样强制执行因为它会让
like weird artifacts because it's going

609
00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:17,460
这个主题它会让它
to make this subject it's going to make

610
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:20,840
学会成为一个善良的主题 的
it learn to be a subject with kind of

611
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,980
对称特征，但人类
symmetrical features but humans are

612
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,659
从来都不是真正对称的，所以最好
never really symmetrical so it's better

613
00:26:24,659 --> 00:26:27,539
保留它，因为人类没有解决
to leave it up for humans don't have

614
00:26:27,539 --> 00:26:30,240
方案的比例桶在我们的例子中，
scale buckets with Solutions in our case

615
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,940
这无关紧要，因为我们的
it's not going to matter because we have

616
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:35,820
图像大于 512 x 512，所以如果我们
image bigger than 512 by 512 so if we

617
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:38,279
有更小的图像 不要升级
had smaller image that don't upscale

618
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:39,840
会让它们变小，而不是将
would keep them small instead of

619
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,539
它们升级到
upscaling them up

620
00:26:41,539 --> 00:26:44,640
桶分辨率步骤，这是一个
bucket resolution steps this is an

621
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,960
有趣的，
interesting one

622
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,039
嗯，
um

623
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:51,720
你可以降到 16 或 32。
you could go down to like 16 or 32.

624
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,720
在我的情况下，我将在 16 时尝试。所以
in my case I'm going to try it at 16. so

625
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,779
我要 执行第 16 步的桶分辨率。
I'm going to do bucket resolution step

626
00:26:57,779 --> 00:27:01,200
所以这就是说，
16. so what that says is that an image

627
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,860
如果图像不完全符合分辨率，则可以将其裁剪 16 个像素，
can be cropped by 16 pixels if it

628
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:07,559
doesn't perfectly fit in the resolution

629
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:10,200
嗯，这是 16 的倍数，将被
uh that's a multiple of 16 that's going

630
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,020
计算为接近 512 x
to get calculated to be close to 512 by

631
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:17,220
512，并且 然后是
512 and then total number of pixels

632
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,279
um

633
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:23,580
实际帮助随机
that is actually helping with the random

634
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:26,279
裁剪而不是中心裁剪选项的总像素数
crop instead of Center crop option that

635
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:28,080
I've got here so what that does is that

636
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,580
every time an image is going to be

637
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:32,100
learned it's going to slightly crop it

638
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,679
所以它会
in a different location so it's going to

639
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:37,140
裁剪图像，所以它会对
crop the image so it's it's going to do

640
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:39,659
图像进行某种抖动，所以它
some kind of Jitter of the image so it's

641
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:41,340
会四处移动一点，如果
going to move around a little bit and if

642
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,860
这有助于稳定扩散，则可以
this helps stable diffusion alert the

643
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:47,100
更好地提醒模型，耳朵越大，
model better and the bigger ear the more

644
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,620
容量就越大 在
capacity it's going to have to crop in

645
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,299
不同的位置裁剪所以如果你
different locations so if you don't want

646
00:27:51,299 --> 00:27:53,400
不想太大但又不想
to go too big but you don't want to go

647
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,140
太小所以也许我会
too small so maybe I'm going to go with

648
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:59,820
在这种情况下使用 32 所以让我们试试它作为脏
32 in this case so let's try it as dirty

649
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:00,960
um
um

650
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,840
Dropout 字幕每一个 bug 我想为
Dropout captions every any bug I want to

651
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,120
每个 Epoch 添加字幕，所以我不会对
caption every Epoch so I'm not going to

652
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,400
字幕
do any Dropout of epochs for captioning

653
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,919
和字幕率进行任何 Dropout Dropout 我想
and a rate of captions Dropout I want to

654
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:14,640
删除 10% 的字幕，所以在每一步
drop 10 percent of the captions so there

655
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,400
都有 10% 10% 的机会
is a 10 percent 10 percent chance that

656
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,220
caption 将被
at every step the caption is going to be

657
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:23,039
删除，这有助于为
dropped out and this is helping give the

658
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,580
模型提供更大的样式灵活性，因此
model more flexibility in styling so

659
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:29,940
启用 uh
it's a good option to have enabled uh

660
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,740
safe training State I don't really want
safe training State I don't really want

661
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:35,340
to do that and Max train Epoch number I
to do that and Max train Epoch number I

662
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:38,400
don't really want 是一个不错的选择 在我的情况下，指定
don't really want to specify and the max

663
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,760
数据加载器的最大工作人员数为零，
number of workers for data loader zero

664
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,640
我发现事情进展得更快，
in my case I find makes things go faster

665
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,039
所以通过将其设置为零，它有助于使
so by setting this to zero it helps make

666
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,740
事情变得更快，所以这是我
things faster so this is the config I've

667
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,720
为这次培训获得的配置，所以现在事情
got for this training so now that things

668
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,400
已经配置好了 我要去把
are configured I'm going to go and save

669
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,580
它保存到我的配置文件中，我们已经
this to my config file and we're pretty

670
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:58,620
准备好训练了，
much ready to train

671
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,220
um

672
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,679
正如我所说的，我将向你展示
as I said I'm going to show you the the

673
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,500
learning rate curve that is generated by

674
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,120
这个版本生成的学习率曲线，这是一个
this version by the way this is a

675
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,179
那个版本，嗯，
version that uh

676
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:12,179
我们已经到了这里，嗯，
that we've got here uh

677
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:14,340
韩国 SS，我们将进入
Korean SS we're just going to go into

678
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,440
代码，所以如果
the code so I've got like a branch if

679
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:19,020
你想使用它，我有一个分支，嗯，你可以去
you want to use it uh you can go and

680
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:21,480
看看学习率免费分支
look at the learning rate free branch

681
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:24,120
和这个 是
and this is where the code for the

682
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:28,100
实际学习率免费的代码所在的地方，
actual learning rate free is located

683
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,779
所以如果你想尝试它，
so if you want to try it that's where

684
00:29:30,779 --> 00:29:33,059
你可以在那里找到它，
you could find it

685
00:29:33,059 --> 00:29:36,720
所以现在让我们开始训练
okay so now let's go and start training

686
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,120
贸易模型，现在让我们快速查看
trade model and now let's quickly look

687
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,220
输出
at the output

688
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,559
并确保它会 开始
and make sure that it's going to start

689
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:46,440
很好，没有任何错误，
fine without any errors

690
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,179
所以你可以在这里看到我的
so as you can see here I've got my

691
00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:51,299
桶最多包含 50 张图像，
buckets that contains up to 50 image

692
00:29:51,299 --> 00:29:53,940
每个桶都有更多图像，因为
each some have more image because the

693
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:56,340
更多图片
more pictures were kind of fitted within

694
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:59,460
在裁剪后适合 512 x 512 分辨率，
this 512 by 512 resolutions after a

695
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:02,220
这将有所帮助
cropping which is going to help with

696
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:04,440
训练期间图像的抖动，
that Jitter of the image during the

697
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,659
现在它已经开始
training and now it's already started

698
00:30:06,659 --> 00:30:09,080
训练了，我们将
training and we are going to train for

699
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,940
总共训练 550 步，
550 steps total

700
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:15,059
在训练期间让我们去
and while this trains let's go and grab

701
00:30:15,059 --> 00:30:18,360
看看实际的日志，以便我们可以
a look at the actual logs so that we can

702
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,399
看到实际的学习率
see the actual learning rate in action

703
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,440
你会在这里开始看到
you're going to start to see here that

704
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:25,260
动态学习率 0 和
the dynamic learning rate zero and

705
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:27,179
动态学习率 1 的
dynamic learning rate one are going to

706
00:30:27,179 --> 00:30:29,880
值将随着时间的推移开始增加，
start to increase in value over time

707
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:33,840
因为系统实际上是在
because the system is is actually

708
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,480
查看训练的结果
kind of looking at the results of the

709
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,460
并决定学习是否
training and deciding if the learning

710
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,980
应该增加速率以产生
rate should be increased to produce even

711
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:43,200
更好的结果，以便随着训练的
better results so as the training

712
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,480
进行，该学习率将
progress this learning rate is going to

713
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,419
在整个训练过程中发生变化，这
change throughout the training and this

714
00:30:48,419 --> 00:30:50,580
就是动态适应的作用，它会
is what the dynamic adaptation does it

715
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,440
kind of calculates the training the

716
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,659
根据
learning rate for you based on the

717
00:30:54,659 --> 00:30:58,500
每次训练的结果为您计算训练学习率 步骤
results of each training steps

718
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,860
所以让我们来看看
so let's go and look at the actual

719
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,860
包含日志的实际文件夹
folder that contains

720
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:07,260
our logs

721
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,720
这是包含日志的文件夹
so here this is the folder that contains

722
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,220
我要复制最后一条
the logs I'm going to copy that last

723
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:14,399
路径 现在我要到这里
path and now I'm going to go here and go

724
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,799
进入我的
into my uh

725
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:20,840
终端窗口 我有
terminal window where I've got

726
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:26,220
能力启动张量奖，也就是
the ability to fire up the tensor award

727
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,919
这些，观众可以在日志
which is these which is the viewer to

728
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:31,559
运行时实际查看日志，
actually get to view the logs as it runs

729
00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:34,860
我将启动张量板，
I'm going to fire up tensorboard

730
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:37,980
我要去，我要去，
and I'm gonna gonna and I'm gonna go and

731
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:41,100
控制点击 localhost 6006 这样它
control click on localhost 6006 so it's

732
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,620
就会打开一个 tensorboard 的视图，
going to open up a view of tensorboard

733
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,360
正如你所看到的，我们已经
and as you can see we're already

734
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,539
开始看到
starting to see the loss average for the

735
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:51,120
模型实际训练的平均损失，在这里
actual training of the model and here

736
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,820
你可以看到实际
you can see the ramp up of the actual

737
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:57,120
学习率的上升 在
learning rate over the steps that were

738
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,100
到目前为止完成的步骤中，它有点提高了
done so far so it's kind of ramping up

739
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,720
学习率，它有点让
the learning rate and it kind of

740
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,640
你的耳朵稳定下来，然后
plateaued your ear a little bit then

741
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,740
在那里有点稳定，现在它
kind of plateaued there and now it's got

742
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,840
就像一个大平台，所以我认为它
like a big Plateau so I think it figured

743
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,600
发现这是
out that this is the appropriate

744
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:13,559
为该模型设置合适的学习率，如果
learning rate for this model and if

745
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:15,240
一切顺利，它将在
everything goes well it's going to stick

746
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,399
接下来的训练课程中坚持使用该学习率
with that learning rate for the rest of

747
00:32:17,399 --> 00:32:18,779
the training session

748
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:20,520
，
and

749
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:23,760
我相信如果您要查看
I believe that if you are to go and look

750
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,039
该学习率的实际值，
at the actual value of that learning

751
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:31,679
即 uh 2.86 e
rate which is uh 2.86 e minus zero five

752
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:38,220
uh 文本编码器减零五，单位减去 0
for the uh text encoder and 1.14 minus 0

753
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:43,140
4，这
4 for the unit this is

754
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:45,899
几乎是或接近
pretty much the value or close to the

755
00:32:45,899 --> 00:32:48,240
我们作为默认值得到的值，这个
value that we've got as the default this

756
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,559
值是默认值的
one is

757
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:51,720
两倍，因为我有点
twice as small because I'm kind of

758
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,700
强迫它 通过
forcing it that way through the

759
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:56,279
hard-coded version of the dynamic

760
00:32:56,279 --> 00:32:59,100
我得到的动态适应的硬编码版本，但这
adaptation that I've got but this is

761
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,679
实际上非常接近我们想要的
actually pretty close to what we want

762
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,140
和我们在默认配置中拥有的，
and what we have in the default

763
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:07,740
所以这表明
configuration so that goes to show that

764
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:10,340
默认值
that default value of

765
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:14,519
0.0001 实际上非常准确 就
0.0001 was actually pretty accurate as

766
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:18,000
being one of the good training value for

767
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,440
low rows

768
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,440
我们而言，它是低划船的良好训练价值之一，
as far as we are concerned

769
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:25,200
所以我们需要进行
so we're gonna we're gonna need to go to

770
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,500
650 步，所以我要暂停这个，
650 steps so I'm going to pause this and

771
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,480
让训练完成，然后我们
let the training complete and then we

772
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,580
可以看看 模型的结果
can look at the result of the model

773
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:38,039
没问题，所以训练刚刚完成，
okay so the training just completed and

774
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:41,220
正如你所看到的，我们有一个相当不错的
as you can see uh we have a fairly nice

775
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,899
曲线，
curve of

776
00:33:42,899 --> 00:33:45,240
在开始时发生了很多学习，
lots of learning happening at the

777
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,519
学习非常强烈，
beginning learning very strongly and

778
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:50,279
然后它进入了一个迭代
then it kind of gets into a iteration

779
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:52,559
阶段，它一直在迭代
phase here where it just keeps iterating

780
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,539
然后迭代，此时它有点好转，
and iterating and it kind of gets better

781
00:33:54,539 --> 00:33:57,779
它有点开始上升了
at this point it kind of started to rise

782
00:33:57,779 --> 00:34:00,120
一点，所以如果
a little bit so what I would kind of if

783
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,279
我要重做这个训练，它可能会
I was to redo this training it would

784
00:34:02,279 --> 00:34:05,000
停止在
probably stop at around

785
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:11,580
500 或 400 左右，大约 70 步或附近
500 or 400 and sort of 70 steps or near

786
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,619
点所以那是因为在那之后
that point so that's because after that

787
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:15,540
它似乎有点上升
it seems to kind of Rise a little bit

788
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:18,659
然后它很漂亮它停止改进它相当
then it pretty it's stopped improving it

789
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:21,000
开始有点燃烧
pretty started to kind of burn a little

790
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,800
模型在这一点上它已经过度
bit the models at this point it's over

791
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:27,060
烘烤但是是的这个
baked but yeah this nice downward

792
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:29,879
向下倾斜的学习率曲线是
sloping learning rate curve here is kind

793
00:34:29,879 --> 00:34:31,739
那种你想看到的，当它像那样
of what you want to see and when it kind

794
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:33,719
再次上升时，这
of rises again like that that's kind of

795
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:36,119
表明情况没有
a sign that things are not improving

796
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:38,760
太大改善，可能模型就像
much and probably the model is just like

797
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,699
在那个时候开始燃烧，但现在让我们看看
starting to burn at that point but now

798
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:43,199
这个模型是什么
let's have a look at what this model

799
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,119
看起来像
looks like so

800
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:47,280
um 模型再次保存在这个
um the model was saved again in this

801
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,300
位置作为 White Queen
location as the White Queen

802
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:53,460
v1.0 所以我将复制它
v1.0 so I'm just going to copy that

803
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,918
并且我们将以稳定的扩散进入这里
and we're gonna go here in stable

804
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:57,420
diffusion

805
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:00,420
um 我还有另一个视频我刚刚
um and I've had another video I just

806
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,980
完成并且 然后录制并
completed and then recorded and

807
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,720
发布在 YouTube 上，但我们将
published on YouTube but we're going to

808
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:07,260
利用相同的提示，我们
leverage that same prompt and we're just

809
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:10,680
将用
going to replace the Laura that was in

810
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,420
我们刚刚创建的新提示替换旧提示中的劳拉，
this old one with the new one that we

811
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,560
just created

812
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:16,440
所以白皇后和我要接受
so the White Queen and I'm gonna take

813
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:19,140
这里的实际标记或
the actual token here or the trigger

814
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:22,440
我应该说的触发词并将其作为
word I should say and put that as the

815
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,020
触发词放在后面这样它会触发
trigger word after such that it triggers

816
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:27,780
整个模型然后让我们确保
the whole model and then let's make sure

817
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:29,579
那里没有任何东西会把
there's nothing in there that would kind

818
00:35:29,579 --> 00:35:33,599
事情分开好吧大胆的
of break things apart okay kind of bold

819
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:35,760
红唇她不会 已经建好了，
red lips she doesn't have already built

820
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,160
所以我们要
so we're just gonna go and take out the

821
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,260
red lips

822
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:43,619
在这里拿出红唇版本，嗯，
version here uh

823
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:46,320
我猜苗条的身体戴着鹅卵石，
um I guess slim body wearing a pebble

824
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,940
我们真的不想改变我们的
well we don't really want to change our

825
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:50,099
地址，我们想看看她是否会
address we want to see if she's going to

826
00:35:50,099 --> 00:35:52,020
一起来 她
come with her

827
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:55,140
标准的白色女王礼服，我们
standard white queen dress and we can

828
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:56,880
可以在它之后把它放回去，看看
potentially put it back after it and see

829
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,800
我们是否可以像她的实际礼服一样改变，
if we can change like her actual dress

830
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,859
或者如果模型太僵硬以至于
or if the model is so rigid that it's

831
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:03,660
不允许我们那样做，
not going to allow us to do that

832
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,940
好吧，所以我认为这很好呃
okay so I think that's pretty good uh

833
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,740
一切 其他都很好所以让我们
everything else is fine so let's give it

834
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:10,440
试一试让我们
a try let's generate

835
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:13,980
在花园里生成四张白皇后的照片
four pictures of the White Queen in a

836
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:14,940
garden

837
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,980
希望我们能得到好的
and hopefully we're gonna get good

838
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:19,920
结果到目前为止我还不知道它看起来
results I don't know so far it looks

839
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,599
很不错啊
pretty good

840
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:27,000
是的看起来像我们的
ah yeah that looks like our

841
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,579
我猜 正如你所看到的那样，花园
and I guess the garden as you can see

842
00:36:29,579 --> 00:36:31,619
吸收了很多
it's picking up a lot of the look and

843
00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:35,700
图像的外观和感觉，嗯，这是
feel of the image that uh was the

844
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,680
电影的坐姿，嗯，
sitting for the movie

845
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,820
um

846
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:42,420
很多这些图像，所以它
so a lot of those image so what does it

847
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:44,640
看起来是什么，那张脸看起来很棒，
look over that one is looking great the

848
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,320
但那是因为它是 有点
face but that's because it's kind of a

849
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,920
小，嗯，是的，
small smallish piece uh yeah that one

850
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,020
看起来不错，看起来
looks pretty good

851
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:55,320
不错，这张地球的脸
looking good this one Earth face is a

852
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,119
有点奇怪，但我们可以尝试
little weird but that we could try

853
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:58,920
像我
something like the what I was showing up

854
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,200
在另一个
in the other

855
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:05,160
视频中出现的东西，让我们把它发送给群众演员，让我们把
video let's send that to extras let's

856
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:08,640
分辨率提高一倍 那一张
double up the resolution of that one

857
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,460
图片所以一张图片我们只是
image so a single image we're just gonna

858
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:14,099
用swin IR加倍
double up with swin IR

859
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:16,440
好吧所以让我们运行它然后
okay so let's run it

860
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,420
一旦它加倍我将把
and then once it's doubled I'm going to

861
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:21,000
它发送到油漆中我们将
send it to in paint and we're going to

862
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,440
看看
see

863
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,500
我们是否真的可以修复 脸部以
if we can actually fix the face in a

864
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,119
正确的方式，所以现在我得到了图像
right way so now I've got the image what

865
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,680
我要去我想做的是回到
I'm going what I want to do is go back

866
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,320
这里发送这张照片，这是一个不好的
here send this picture which is the bad

867
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:34,200
油漆现在我们有所有
one to in paint now we have all of the

868
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,060
关于劳拉的文字和
text about the Laura and the config

869
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:38,880
那里的配置，我想回到额外的部分
there and I want to go back into extras

870
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,820
并拍下那张并排照片并将
and take that abreast picture and send

871
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,680
其发送到窗格中，这样它将取代
it to in pane so it's going to replace

872
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,020
我们拥有的那个版本，但具有
that version that we had but with the

873
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:49,200
双分辨率版本，现在我
double resolution version and now I'm

874
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,060
将进入
just going to go in

875
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:54,300
面具 我们想要在油漆中处理的脸
mask the face that we want to sort of in

876
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,339
paint

877
00:37:56,339 --> 00:37:59,339
可能会更好，
it may be a better one

878
00:37:59,339 --> 00:38:02,099
好吧，我要去这里
okay and I'm going to go here and make

879
00:38:02,099 --> 00:38:06,240
确保我们有 512 x 512 的
sure we have 512 by 512 resolution for

880
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,000
渲染分辨率，所以我们只遮盖了这
the rendering so we only masked that's

881
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,160
很好我们要给它一些
fine we're going to give it some mean

882
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,260
重新创建的平均方式所以让我们尝试生成
way to recreate so let's try to generate

883
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:15,420
一张新面孔，看看模型是否
a new face and see if the model is good

884
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:18,660
足够好，让
enough to get us a better face indeed

885
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:21,480
我们得到一张
when the faces so now we have a much

886
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,700
更好的面孔
much better face compared to what we

887
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,260
在
used to have here if you look at the

888
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:28,440
原来的脸上很糟糕如果你看看
original face pretty bad if you look at

889
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:31,560
新的彩绘脸更好我们
the new in painted face much better we

890
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,359
甚至可以尝试生成一个新版本
could even try to generate a new version

891
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:34,980
只是为了看看我们是否可以得到更好的东西
just to see if we could get something

892
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,660
even better

893
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:39,060
就像测试一样是的
just as a test

894
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:42,240
确实我们有两个很像
and yeah indeed we have a much like the

895
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,700
以前的面孔非常好所以
two previous faces were pretty good so

896
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,320
现在我们有一个更好的版本所以
now we have a much better version so

897
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,260
这就是你如何再次快速修复看起来
that's how again you can quickly fix a

898
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,000
有点奇怪的面孔
face that kind of looks a little weird

899
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,940
并修复它我们甚至可以尝试修复
and fix it and we could even try to fix

900
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,740
这个我不知道它是否会继续
this one I don't know if it's going to

901
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:57,960
工作，但如果我们真的想尝试，
work but like if we wanted to really try

902
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,960
我们可以去发送它，将
we could go and send it extra

903
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,280
分辨率提高一倍，将
double up the resolution

904
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:15,060
其发送到油漆中，去除，在脸上放置一个
send that to in paint remove that put a

905
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:18,780
合适的面具，
proper mask around the face for this one

906
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:24,000
让我们确保我们有 512 x 512
and let's make sure we have 512 by 512

907
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,940
让我们看看如何 我们可以更好地改善那张脸
let's see how we could improve that face

908
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:33,119
much better

909
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:36,119
所以现在我们在那个角色上有更好的脸
so now we have a better face on that

910
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:38,520
所以是的所以我认为那个模型
character so yeah so I think that model

911
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:45,420
呃看起来还不错呃我认为这
is uh looking not so bad uh I think it's

912
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:48,359
又是Gan可能有点
again the Gan might be a little bit too

913
00:39:48,359 --> 00:39:50,220
太强了因为我认为它给出了 一张
strong because I think it gives like a

914
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:53,220
脸看起来有点太干净了，
little bit too clean looking of a face

915
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:55,920
但其他一切看起来都很好，比如
but everything else looks very good like

916
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:00,000
珍珠项链晚上的头发
the the pearl necklace the hair evening

917
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,599
很棒，我想我们只需要让
is awesome I think we just need to get

918
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:04,680
那张
that

919
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:07,680
脸不那么完美，
face a little less perfect

920
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:11,339
所以再说一次，这不是一个坏瓶子，它
so again that's not a bad bottle it may

921
00:40:11,339 --> 00:40:13,260
实际上可能很好 在某些情况下，
actually be good in some occasions to

922
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:16,079
有一个模型可以产生如此完美的面孔，
have a model that produces perfect faces

923
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:19,440
看起来非常干净，但
like that like so very clean looking but

924
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,920
我想这可能不是每个人的脸，所以要
I guess it may not be to everyone's face

925
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,440
解决这个问题，那就要重新运行
so to fix that then it would be to rerun

926
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,260
Gan 清理，但 Lesser
the Gan cleanup but with the Lesser

927
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,720
strike 可能会达到 50% 而不是
strike maybe at 50 percent instead of a

928
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,839
全力以赴 现在让我们看看我们是否
full strength and now let's see if we

929
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:35,820
真的能让她穿另一件
can actually get her to wear a different

930
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:38,940
衣服 所以如果我们去说穿
dress so if we go and say a wearing a

931
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:42,060
头饰 穿 Peplum 裙子
headlam a Peplum dress

932
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:44,640
不管它意味着什么 所以让我们试试吧 让我们
whatever it means so let's try it and

933
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,680
看看这是否真的能让
let's see if that would actually enable

934
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:50,280
我们 改变模型，让我们
us to change the model and let's

935
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:53,579
看看就颜色而言，它看起来相当僵硬，
let's see it looks fairly rigid as far

936
00:40:53,579 --> 00:40:55,560
因为据了解
as the color goes because it's learned

937
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,540
她现在穿的是白色的，这件衣服
that she's wearing white now the dress

938
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:01,339
看起来
looks slightly different

939
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,619
与她平时穿的那件略有不同，
from the one that she's usually wearing

940
00:41:04,619 --> 00:41:06,619
嗯，
um

941
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:09,599
但是再次骑自行车，他们都真的
but again the biking them all really

942
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:12,599
真的知道了一件衣服
really learned that one dress

943
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:15,300
并且很难让它
and it's going to be very difficult to

944
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:18,660
忘记那个
make it forget about that one so

945
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:20,640
所以是的，
yeah it's uh

946
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,160
我认为我们真的
I think we really learned the look of

947
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,200
通过衣服，
the character with the dress and with

948
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,480
发型和面部化妆等等了解了角色的外观，
the hairstyle and with the face makeup

949
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:30,300
我想你可以在
and whatnot uh I guess as you can see

950
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:32,700
这里看到 这些角色都没有
here none of these characters have a

951
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,980
皇冠我们所做的美丽是
crown the beauty of what we've done is

952
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:38,280
内部应该能够看到白
interior should be able to see the White

953
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:41,180
皇后我现在可以说皇冠
Queen I could say crown

954
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:44,640
应该创造出
now that should create image of the

955
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,760
戴着皇冠的白皇后的形象因为
White Queen wearing a crown because the

956
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,660
劳拉应该根据
Laura should have learned based on the

957
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:55,079
说明皇冠是什么意思，是
captioning what Crown means and yep

958
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:57,720
的，现在当我们使用提示调用皇冠时，她确实戴着她的皇冠，
indeed now she's wearing her crown when

959
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:00,720
we invoke the crown using

960
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:03,599
the prompt

961
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:07,140
我们甚至可以尝试
and we could even go as far as trying to

962
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:10,619
索要一把剑，除非只有
ask for a sword unless there's only like

963
00:42:10,619 --> 00:42:13,079
三四张图片实际上是一把剑的
three or four picture where a sword was

964
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:14,700
标题，所以我 我不确定
actually captioned so I'm not sure if

965
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,800
它是否会做得很好，
it's gonna do a very good job

966
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,320
但如果我们看一下所有这些，
but if we look at all of those the

967
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,720
实际模型实际上非常
actual model is pretty actually pretty

968
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:24,359
好，我的意思
good I mean the quality

969
00:42:24,359 --> 00:42:28,200
是质量非常好，它
is pretty darn good it's very it's

970
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:31,619
看起来很像电影中的照片
looking a lot like the pictures uh of

971
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:35,579
和 让我们试着要一把
the movie and let's try to ask for a

972
00:42:35,579 --> 00:42:36,560
剑，
sword

973
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,359
让我们看看这
and let's see if that's going to work I

974
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:41,400
don't know

975
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:45,540
can we get er to wear her crown with a

976
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:47,700
sword

977
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:50,720
in her hands

978
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:56,520
he could kind of tries to do that maybe

979
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,079
是否有效
there is where there was not enough

980
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:01,020
她拿着剑的照片，所以
pictures of her holding a sword so it's

981
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:03,480
有点尝试，
kind of trying it

982
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,819
但效果很差
but it's doing a pretty bad job about it

983
00:43:05,819 --> 00:43:08,520
所以并不感到惊讶，因为
so not surprised because there was so

984
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:12,359
图像太少了，嗯，所以剑的东西
few image uh yeah so the sword thing is

985
00:43:12,359 --> 00:43:14,880
很好，她拿着剑时没有戴
well she was not wearing a crown when

986
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,460
皇冠 所以从理论上讲，通过
she was holding a sword so in theory by

987
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:20,280
移除王冠我们可以获得
removing the crown we might be able to

988
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:22,740
更好的结果
get better results

989
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:24,540
是的，我很好奇这是否会
yeah I'm curious to see if that would

990
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:26,780
奏效
work

991
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,960
剑会更好，
the sword is going to come out better

992
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,119
因为我们不再为
now that we are not fighting with the

993
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:35,960
我们想要王冠和
fact that we want a crown and the sword

994
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:39,060
一系列图片中的剑
in a series of pictures that were never

995
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:41,819
现在从未见过即使没有王冠也没有用呃做那么好的工作
seen now didn't do that great of a job

996
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:44,700
with the uh even without the crown

997
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:48,000
但它让你清楚地知道
but it gives you an idea uh clearly that

998
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,280
模型
model didn't have enough enough swords

999
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:53,460
在呃数据集中没有足够的剑来 正确地了解
in the uh data set to properly learn

1000
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:56,400
上下文中的剑是什么，但它
what the sword is in the context but it

1001
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,560
给你一点
kind of gives you a hint of

1002
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,140
剑的暗示，所以你可以看到它是以
of a sword so you can see that it was

1003
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:03,420
一种奇怪的方式学习的，
learned in in a weird way but it was

1004
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:07,140
但无论如何我希望你们发现
learned so anyway I hope you guys found

1005
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:09,720
这很有趣，那就是 你
this uh interesting and that's how you

1006
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,280
如何创建一个家，如果你
can create a home and if you're

1007
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,040
感兴趣，我可能会发布
interested I'm gonna probably publish

1008
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:17,819
我刚刚在 civit AI 上做的那个模型，
that exact model that I just did here on

1009
00:44:17,819 --> 00:44:19,800
我会把链接
civit AI and I'm going to put the link

1010
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,720
放在 YouTube 视频的描述中，
in the description of the YouTube video

1011
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,660
这样你就可以去 尝试玩它，
so you can go and try to play with it

1012
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:25,980
呃，再见，
and uh enjoy

1013
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:28,700
伙计们
bye guys
