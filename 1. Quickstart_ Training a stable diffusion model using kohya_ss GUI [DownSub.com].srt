good morning dream book users

2
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,240
嗯
um

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,440
我想给你一个关于如何
I want to give you a quick start on how

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,680
使用 Koya SS
to use the Koya SS

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,119
Dreamboat 回购的快速入门这样你就可以快速
Dreamboat repo so that you can quickly

6
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:22,320
开始训练你自己更多
get going with training your own more

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,240
嗯这个快速入门不会是
um this quick start is not going to be

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,720
关于如何实际安装 Korea
about how to actually install the Korea

9
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,599
SS 你实际上可以从 GitHub 下载它，
SS you can actually download it from

10
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:33,320
如果你搜索
GitHub if you search for

11
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,120
bmltis slash Koya assessed 你将
bmltis slash Koya assessed you'll be

12
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,820
能够找到
able to find a copy

13
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,940
该软件的副本然后你可以克隆
of the software and then you can clone

14
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,800
你可以按照说明
and you can follow the instructions on

15
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,780
如何需要
how like what are the required

16
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,180
依赖项和 安装步骤
dependencies and the installation steps

17
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,539
到达你
to get going up to the point where you

18
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:55,980
实际去的地方，你启动 GUI 来
actually go and you start the GUI to

19
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,140
实际训练你的模型，所以你使用
actually train your model so you use

20
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,300
这个命令 python dream boot
this command python dream boot

21
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,019
underscore gui.pi 这将使
underscore gui.pi and this will get the

22
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:07,560
训练器运行的 GUI 所以让我们从
GUI for the trainer running so let's

23
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,540
那里开始 然后我将向您展示如何
start there and then I'll show you how

24
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,299
使用 GUI 来训练您自己的
you can use the GUI to train your own

25
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:14,540
模型，
model

26
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:23,520
因此我们将进入 excess
so we're going to go into the excess

27
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,220
文件夹，您可以看到 venp 已经
folder you can see that the venp is

28
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,840
处于活动状态，因为
already active because it's important

29
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,460
您需要激活虚拟
you need to activate your virtual

30
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,220
环境以便它 如果
environment so that it runs properly if

31
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,659
你只是安装它，它会正常运行然后它会
you just install it then it's going to

32
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:35,280
默认激活但是如果你在
be activated by default but if you go

33
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,640
呃你实际上关闭了
back after uh you actually closed

34
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,140
所有它们已经准备好的
everything they are ready with the

35
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,340
计算机之后返回然后如果你想再次使用它
computer then if you want to use it

36
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,900
你将需要运行这个
again you're gonna need to run this

37
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,180
命令就像 这是点反斜杠
command like which is the dot backslash

38
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,020
是 EnV
be EnV

39
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:52,619
反斜杠脚本，然后激活
backslash scripts and then activate

40
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:55,140
，这就是你实际激活
and that's how you actually activate the

41
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,340
版本的方式所以让我们开始
version so let's start

42
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,020
python
python

43
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,640
真正启动
really boot

44
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,399
我不想通过馅饼得到它
I don't want to get it through the pie

45
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:08,098
，这将提高程度
and this is going to fire up the degree

46
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:11,038
，现在它是 准备好加载，所以我们
and now it is ready to load so we're

47
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,020
要控制点击那个链接，
gonna control click on that link and

48
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,819
这将为韩国党卫军教练员带来无线电用户界面，
this is going to bring the radio UI for

49
00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:19,860
Korea SS trainer

50
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,560
所以有几个
so there's a couple of

51
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,480
选项卡，我们将通过
tabs we're kind of going to go through

52
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,459
那些对你很重要的选项卡 将
the ones that are important to you what

53
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:28,500
需要所以第一个是
you're going to need so the first one is

54
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,200
你需要使用一个小的权利当
you need to use a sore small right when

55
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,879
你想训练一些东西你需要
you want to train something you need to

56
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,980
向模型添加一些东西所以
add something to a model so there's a

57
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,840
这里有几个选项你可以使用可选的
couple of options here you can use the

58
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,440
快速选择在这里你可以使用
optional Quick Picks here you can use

59
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,660
就像将稳定扩散扩散
like either diffuse the stable diffusion

60
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,180
到一个底座一样，您可以使用这些演示
to one base you can use these demo

61
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,840
扩散 2.1，它是 768 x 768
diffusion 2.1 which is the 768 by 768

62
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,140
模型，您可以使用稳定扩散
model you could use stable diffusion

63
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:54,480
视图。15 或 v.14
view.15 or v.14

64
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,459
如果您想使用快速选择，那么
if you want to use the Quick Picks then

65
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:58,440
您只需点击让我们 看到我们
you just literally click on let's see we

66
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,019
想在 2.1 基础上训练，它将在
want to train on the 2.1 base it's going

67
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:04,080
to fill in the 2.1 base free train model

68
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,599
那里填写 2.1 基础免费训练模型名称，然后这就是它
name there and then that's how it could

69
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:09,599
开始测试的方式你也可以选择使用
start testing you could also opt to use

70
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:14,340
这个文件图标打开然后
this file icon to open up and then

71
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,480
这就是你要做的事情 请注意，
that's something you're going to notice

72
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,940
您已经看到实际的
right you've seen the actual

73
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,879
弹出窗口在浏览器后面打开
pop-up window open behind the browser

74
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,920
，这有点
and that's kind of a little bit of a

75
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,560
消除了，现在 GUI 弹出
eliminations right now the GUI pop-up

76
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,840
窗口不会在顶部打开，因此您
windows will not open on top so that you

77
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,760
可能不得不去钓鱼 它在
may have to go and fish for it behind

78
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,620
你的浏览器窗口后面，尤其是当它被
your browser window especially if it was

79
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,959
最大化时，你不会看到它打开，所以如果
maximized you wouldn't see it open so if

80
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:35,459
你点击按钮，它
you click on the button and it does

81
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:37,739
似乎什么也没做，那么只需最小化
appear to do nothing then just minimize

82
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:39,900
或移动你的浏览器窗口，
or move your browser window around and

83
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,640
然后你就会发现它在后面
then you are going to find it behind

84
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,920
所以 回到那里，你可以去
so going back there you could go and

85
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,099
选择一个模型，呃让我
pick for example a model uh let me go

86
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:49,200
去我妈妈的文件夹，你可以
and get to my mom folder and you could

87
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,819
去选择一个你想要的模型，
go and pick one of the models you want

88
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:53,000
例如我们要选择这个
we're going to pick for example this one

89
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,519
uh 512 base EMA 这样 将是一个 V2
uh 512 base EMA so that would be a V2

90
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:59,940
模型，我将打开它，它是一个 CK
model that I would open up which is a CK

91
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,819
ckpt 形式，然后显然当你
ckpt form and then obviously when you

92
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:04,739
加载你自己的自定义模型时，你
load your own custom model you're gonna

93
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:07,860
需要指定它是什么，就像这个
need to specify what it is like this one

94
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,500
是 V2 模型，所以我不必
is a V2 model so I wouldn't have to make

95
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,900
确保我单击 V2 并且它不是 v
sure that I click V2 and it's not a v

96
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,879
参数化 mod，因为它不是
parameterization mod because it's not

97
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,139
768 x 768 版本，因此如果您使用其中一个快速选择，则
this the 768 by 768 version so you have

98
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:22,620
必须指定实际建模是什么，
to specify what is the actual modeling

99
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,300
if you use one of the Quick Picks for

100
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,280
例如如果我禁用它并且
example if I just if I disable that and

101
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,500
我 再次单击其中一个“快速选择”
I click on one of the Quick Picks again

102
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,780
以获得这个，嗯，我想是
for this one uh well I guess a different

103
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,639
另一个，所以它不是这个，所以现在
one so it's so it's not this one so now

104
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,440
你可以看到它实际上会指定
you can see it will actually specify the

105
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,160
正确的选项，所以如果我进入 2-1 模型，
right option so if I go into a 2-1 model

106
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,479
那么它就会 说它是一个
then it's going to say it's a v

107
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,580
带有 V2 的 v 参数化模型，它
parameterization model with V2 it's all

108
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,580
都包含在那些快速选择中，但是如果
all bakes into those Quick Picks but if

109
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,880
您手动选择 CP ckpt 或
you manually select the CP ckpt or a

110
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,860
保存的答案文件，那么您将必须
saved answer file then you're gonna have

111
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:53,100
指定这个模型是关于什么的，所以
to specify what this model is about so

112
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,860
为了快速入门，让我们选择一个
for this quick start let's pick one of

113
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,900
这些默认的快速选择，所以我将
these default Quick Picks so I'm going

114
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,840
使用呃稳定扩散 2.1
to go with the uh stable diffusion 2.1

115
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,320
基础，这是一个 512 x 512
base which is a 512 by 512

116
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,060
训练模型，
trained model

117
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,860
接下来你
and the next thing you're going to want

118
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,600
要做的是你会
to do is you're gonna you're gonna want

119
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,600
想要 在实用程序下，这就是
to go under utilities and this is where

120
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,400
我们要为
we're going to structure the actual

121
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,620
cool yes 构建实际文件夹要求的地方，
folder requirements for cool yes as

122
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,259
因为 Koya SS 有一些相当严格
because Koya SS has some fairly strict

123
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:25,979
和晦涩的结构需要训练
and obscure structure required to train

124
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:29,100
，今年它会吐它会为
and this year it's gonna spit it's gonna

125
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,740
你准备一切所以你做你
prepare everything for you so you do you

126
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,539
不必理解和担心如何
don't have to understand and worry about

127
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:35,539
实际命名文件夹结构文件夹等等所以
how to actually name the folders

128
00:05:35,539 --> 00:05:38,520
structure the folders and whatnot so

129
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,340
第一个提示首先是
first prompt first is for the instance

130
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,039
您要使用的实例名称呃通常
name that you're gonna use uh usually

131
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:46,440
它是
it's a keyword that does not exist

132
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:51,419
锦鲤 ISS 空间中不存在的关键字抱歉 在
within the koi ISS space Sorry on in the

133
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:53,820
稳定的扩散空间中，所以你会选择
stable diffusion space so you would pick

134
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,100
像 ASD 这样的东西，在这种情况下，这是
something like ASD in this case which is

135
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,160
一个在模型和课堂上自然已知的标记，
a token that is naturally known within

136
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,020
假设我们
the model and in the class let's say we

137
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,180
想像一个人一样训练，我们将
want to train like a person we're going

138
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,220
使用一个课堂人，
to use a class person

139
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:08,100
因为 假设
because let's say that that token that

140
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,259
我们要关联的那个标记是一个
we're going to associate with is a

141
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:13,080
人的训练图像，但我不是来这里
person training image but I'm not here

142
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,120
给你做这个关于
to give you like this speech about how

143
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,220
梦想靴如何工作的演讲，主要是关于
dream boot works and mostly about like

144
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,560
如何使用 Goya SS 进行梦想靴
how to use Goya SS for dream boot

145
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,800
训练呃训练 一个图像那么
training uh training an image so what

146
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,500
你的训练图像在哪里所以
where where are your training image so

147
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,080
在这种情况下训练图像在我的
training image in this case are in my

148
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,600
快速启动文件夹中并且它们在
quick start folder and they are in the

149
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,600
人中呃抱歉在我的子集
person uh sorry in the subset

150
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,240
文件夹中所以我有
folder that I have so I've got a subset

151
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,340
八个图像的子集用于训练 所以我
of eight image for a training so I'm

152
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,860
要使用子集文件夹，
going to use the subset folder

153
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,960
在这里我要指定
and here I'm going to specify how many

154
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,600
我想要这些图像的重复次数我
repeats of those image do I want so do I

155
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,120
想要 40 次重复我想要训练
want 40 repeats do I want to train for

156
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,940
160 次重复例如在这种情况下让我们
160 repeats for example in this case

157
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,400
说 160 次重复 因为
let's say 160 repeats because there is

158
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,400
只有八张图像，而 160 对于使用 koi ISS 呃正则化图像
only eight image and 160 is sort of a

159
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,860
在八张图像上进行训练是一个很好的数字，
good number for training on eight image

160
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:03,120
using koi ISS uh regularization image do

161
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,720
我想在大多数时候使用正则化图像吗，
I want to use regularization image most

162
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,000
of the time it is a good idea to use

163
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,740
当你尝试远程时使用它们是个好主意所以 我
those when you try to remote so I'm

164
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,600
要去选择正则化
gonna go and pick the regularization

165
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,180
图像文件夹，这将成为我的
image folder which is going to be my

166
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,160
person ddim
person ddim

167
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,259
因为它是一个 person 类所以我要
because it's a person class so I'm going

168
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:22,139
训练一个 person 正则化图像
to train a person regularization image

169
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:25,220
我只想重复
and I only want to repeat the

170
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,860
正则化一次
regularization once

171
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:32,960
然后你指定你的训练呃
then you specify your training uh

172
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,340
目的地培训目录，这是
destination training directory which is

173
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:39,120
我想创建我的 Koya SS
where do I want to create my Koya SS

174
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,020
结构化文件夹的地方，所以在这里我要
structured uh folders so here I'm going

175
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,639
继续并再次单击它我要去
to go ahead and click on this again I'm

176
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,099
并在我的快速启动下选择一些东西
going to go and pick something under my

177
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:49,020
我要打电话
quick start I'm going to call that for

178
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:52,440
例如，新文件夹，我将其命名为
example new folder I'm going to call it

179
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,580
um
um

180
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,580
kuya
kuya

181
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,419
training，将其
training

182
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,979
call it Korea training

183
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:04,259
命名为 Korea training，我将选择它作为
and I'm gonna do a good select that as

184
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:05,940
我的目标文件夹，这样现在我们可以
my destination folder so now we can

185
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:09,240
单击准备训练数据，
click on prepare training data

186
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,340
它实际上应该启动并且
it should actually fire up and it's

187
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,560
正在运行 告诉你它复制了这些
going to tell you that it copied these

188
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,460
东西 uh 复制了子集到这个
things uh copied the subset to this

189
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:20,819
文件夹，它复制了 person ddim 到
folder and it copied the person ddim to

190
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:23,639
这个文件夹，正确的名字是
this folder with the proper name being

191
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:27,300
你的令牌和类名所以它
your token and the class name so it's

192
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,539
完成了创建所有必需的文件夹
done creating all of the required folder

193
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:32,219
结构所以我们很好
structure so that we are good to

194
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:34,440
继续所以接下来要做的
continue so the next thing you want to

195
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,860
是点击复制信息到
do is you want to click on copy info to

196
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,659
目录堆栈因为如果我们
directory stack because if we go to the

197
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:41,099
现在转到目录样式你可以看到
directory style right now you can see

198
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:42,839
它是空的它需要像
it's empty it needs to be filled like

199
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:44,940
图像文件夹正则化
what is the image folder regularization

200
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,279
文件夹输出一样填充 您可以
folder output directory you could

201
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,899
手动进入目录并选择它们，但是
manually go and pick those up but

202
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:52,019
因为我们使用了这个重启文件夹
because we've used this reboot folder

203
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:54,899
准备实用程序，我们可以复制我们
preparation utility we can just copy the

204
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:57,300
info that was actually

205
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,519
picked up by the configured we've typed

206
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,100
在此处输入的配置实际选择的信息，现在它将填充
here and now it's going to fill the

207
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,380
图像文件夹名称 正则化
image folder name the regularization

208
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,080
文件夹命名输出目录，
folder name the output directory where

209
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,640
我们将实际吐出
we're going to actually spit out the

210
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,519
结果模型和登录目录，
resulting model and the login directory

211
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,820
我想
where we're going to log uh I guess the

212
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,620
训练数据
training data

213
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,360
接下来你要做的是
next thing you're going to want to do is

214
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,620
你要去 想要进入
you're going to want to go under the

215
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,660
训练参数，这是
training parameters and this is where

216
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,640
你要指定你梦想的引导
you're going to specify your dream boot

217
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,640
参数的地方，比如添加大小，就像我的情况一样，
parameters like add size like in my case

218
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,100
我有一个相当强大的卡，它是
I have a fairly powerful card it's a

219
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,160
3090，所以如果你喜欢，我可以做八个批量大小
3090 so I can do batch sizes of eight if

220
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,220
一张 vram 较少的卡，那么
you have like a card with less vram then

221
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,839
您可能希望默认情况下将其保持为
you will probably want to keep that to

222
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:38,160
一个，即
one

223
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,519
epochs 的数量，因此
by default the the number of epochs so

224
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,820
how many iterations of the of the number

225
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:45,720
of

226
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,880
我们指定的重复次数的迭代次数
repeats that we that we have specified

227
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,060
是我们想要做的，我只想做一个
do we want to do I only want to do one

228
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:54,240
嗯，这些都是
um how like those are all the typical

229
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,920
您已经知道的所有典型参数，对吧，
parameter that you already know right

230
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,480
我不是很好，我不是要真正
I'm not good I'm not there to really

231
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,279
教您如何进行排水引导，而是教您更多
teach you how to do drain boot but more

232
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,440
如何使用此 GUI 快速开始工作，
how to use this GUI to quickly get going

233
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,899
以便您可以进行配置 就像
so you can go and configure like the

234
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:05,279
学习数组
different like the learning array

235
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,320
调度程序一样不同，你可以配置
scheduler you can configure like the

236
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,500
你想要的精确度呃什么样的
Precision that you want uh what kind of

237
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,480
模型保存精度
save Precision for the model the the

238
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,360
你想要的输出模型和谐呃
output model that you want Harmony uh

239
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,420
CPU线程每个进程你
CPU threads the per process do you

240
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,700
实际想要实际使用这是
actually want to actually use this is

241
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,000
计算出来的 通过基于您的 CPU
calculated by the GUI based on your CPU

242
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,399
报告信息的 GUI 所以在我的例子中它是
reported information so in my case it's

243
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,459
12 你想用于交易的 C 在哪里
12 where is the C that you want to use

244
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:31,019
什么是最大
for the trading what is the max

245
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:34,500
分辨率 这是一个重要的你
resolution this is an important one you

246
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,839
需要指定图像的最大分辨率
need to specify the max resolution of

247
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:39,060
所以在我的 如果我使用
your image so in my case I'm trading on

248
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,519
512 x 512 图像进行交易，所以我将设置
512 by 512 image so I'm going to set the

249
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,320
最大分辨率，
max resolution to that

250
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,200
如果您使用标题文件而
if you were to use caption files instead

251
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:51,420
不是使用实际实例名称和
of using the actual instance name and

252
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:54,839
实际类名称，您可以使用
the actual class name you can use an

253
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:56,279
扩展文件来提供
extension file to provide the

254
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:58,800
信息，因此它可能是 txt 文件或
information so it could be a txt file or

255
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,680
DOT 标题文件，因此在这种情况下，我们
a DOT caption file so in this case we're

256
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,940
不会使用我们将
not going to use that we're going to

257
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,920
坚持文件夹命名约定
stick with the folder naming convention

258
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,579
来导出这些虚假信息，因此
for the deriving those disinformation so

259
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:10,279
我们不会使用 标题文件，
we're not going to use a caption file

260
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:13,140
然后如果您想
and then if you wanted to stop the text

261
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:16,560
在训练期间部分停止文本编码，
encoding part way during the training

262
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,140
您可以按百分比指定
you could specify percentage-wise how

263
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:22,019
like how how many percent of the trading

264
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:24,600
您想要使用多少百分比的交易，因为
do you want to use that for

265
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,339
这里有一大堆选项，
there's a whole bunch of options here

266
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:28,440
如果 如果你想
that you can if you don't want token

267
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,360
padding for the training you can specify

268
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,180
使用安全张量作为
it if you want to use safe tensors as

269
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:36,899
你的模型呃格式而不是bin
your model uh format instead of the bin

270
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:38,700
当你使用扩散器模型时它会将
when you use diffusers model it will

271
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,700
它们保存为点安全张量你
save them as dot safe tensors uh do you

272
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,000
想要做渐变 checkpointing or not
want to do gradient checkpointing or not

273
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,339
uh do you want to enable buckets I
uh do you want to enable buckets I I

274
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:49,260
recommend that you keep this or
recommend that you leave this one or

275
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,240
this one on because this is going to
this one on because this is going to

276
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,820
resize your image if you don't enable
resize your image if you don't enable

277
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:57,779
buckets if your image are not all of the
buckets if your image are not all of the

278
00:11:57,779 --> 00:12:00,660
same size such as 512 x 512 或
same size like 512 by 512 or anything

279
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,940
类似的东西那么你会
like that then you're gonna get an error

280
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,980
在训练过程中通过启用
during the training by enabling

281
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,920
分桶得到一个错误它将确保
bucketing it will ensure that all of

282
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,339
你的所有图像都适合这个最大
your image fit within this maximum

283
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:13,380
分辨率空间
resolution space

284
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:16,380
现金潜在使用原子使用
cash latent using the atoms use

285
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:19,740
资源管理器这些都是
explorers those are all typical training

286
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,740
你使用的典型训练配置和这个 是
config that you use and this is where

287
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,980
您现在准备做的另一件事，
you are now ready to go one more thing

288
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:29,040
这很重要，特别是因为我们正在
that's important especially since we are

289
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,459
使用，因为您可以看到基于扩散器的
using as you can see a diffuser based

290
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:33,600
模型，因为它将
model because it's going to be

291
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,540
从稳定性 AI 下载，如果您愿意，我们需要将
downloaded from stability AI we need to

292
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:42,000
其保存为不同的
potentially save this as a different

293
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,660
模型 得到一个
model right if you want to get like a

294
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:48,600
ckpt 文件或一个安全的张量文件，这是
ckpt file or a safe tensors file this is

295
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,880
你要选择我
where you're going to select what is my

296
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,899
想要的最终输出模型的地方，就像我
final output model uh that I want like I

297
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:58,440
希望你将你要交易的那个扩散器
want you to convert that uh diffuser

298
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,600
模型转换成
model that you're going to trade on into

299
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,660
一个 ckpt 文件，这将
a ckpt file and this is going to create

300
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:07,440
在最后创建一个 last.c kptpt 文件，
a last.c kptpt file at the end and

301
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,540
因为这里我们使用的是 V2 模型，
because here we are using a V2 model

302
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,180
它还将创建一个最后的
it's also going to create a last that

303
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:16,019
yaml 文件，GUI 将使用它，例如
yaml file that will be used by GUI like

304
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:19,380
Auto one one one 来知道什么
Auto one one one one to know what

305
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:22,680
加载它们时要使用的参数
parameters to use when loading them up

306
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,959
所以在这种情况下让我们假装我们
so in this case Let's Pretend We're

307
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,320
要使用 ckpt 版本或者
going to want to use the ckpt version or

308
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,300
让我们使用安全张量因为这
let's go with safe tensor because this

309
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,579
是新标准它更安全所以它
is the new standard it's safer so it's

310
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:34,440
被留下而不是创建一个 ckpd 让我们
left instead of creating a ckpd let's

311
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,180
创建一个安全 张量
create a safe tensors

312
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,740
文件格式
file format

313
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,680
然后是的所以我们开始所以我只是
and then yeah so here we go so I'm just

314
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,139
回到这里的源模型或者
gonna go back into Source model here or

315
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:44,399
它并不重要因为经过
it doesn't really matter because the

316
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,800
训练的模型按钮对于 UI
trained model button is global to the UI

317
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,779
是全局的它可能会在
it's something that might change in the

318
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:50,399
未来改变但现在 我可以点击
future but for now I could click on

319
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,920
商标，然后你可以
trademark and then you can look at the

320
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,779
返回这里查看输出，你可以
outputs by going back here and you can

321
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:58,440
在这里看到 UI
see here the actual command that the UI

322
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:03,899
用于启动培训的实际命令呃
is using to launch the trainings uh

323
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:07,260
训练下划线 DB 下划线固定点
train underscore DB underscore fixed dot

324
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:10,380
Pi 所以你可以用它来复制这个 并
Pi so you can use that to copy this and

325
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,779
按摩它，就像你想
massage it as well as if you want to use

326
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:15,600
在事后使用 CLI 一样，这样你就可以
the CLI after the fact right so you can

327
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,639
从字面上接受该命令并
literally take that command and rerun it

328
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:20,459
使用此加速启动通过 CLI 重新运行它，
through the CLI using this accelerate

329
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:23,040
它将开始
launch and it's going to start the

330
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,279
交易会话，就像它在这里所做的那样，
trading session just like it does here

331
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:29,279
所以我' 我会让训练继续进行，所以
so I'll let the training continue so

332
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,779
它现在正在做的事情我猜它正在用
what it's doing right now I guess it's

333
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:33,180
caching all of the latents with the

334
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,339
桶缓存所有的潜伏，所以你可以看到它被剪切了，它是在
buckets so as you can see it's cut it's

335
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:37,500
计算所有图像，并
kind of calculating all of the image and

336
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,500
基于
based on the number of regularization

337
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,079
我的正则化图像的数量 输入现在
image that I have in my input now it's

338
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:45,180
有点随机化并为
kind of going to go and randomize and

339
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,980
create a matching

340
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:52,680
每个图像创建一个匹配呃然后每个正则化
per image uh then uh per regularization

341
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,680
图像以随机方式匹配这样
image match in a random manner such that

342
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,240
训练实际上是完全
the training is actually totally

343
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,560
随机的
randomized

344
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,120
嘿
hey

345
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:04,399
现在缓存所有这些潜在的
is now caching all of those latents

346
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,399
好所以现在它完成了缓存和 正如您所
okay so now it's done caching and as you

347
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,120
看到的，如果我们向上滚动它实际上
can see if we scroll back up it actually

348
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,920
创建了
created

349
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:18,959
2560 512 乘以 512 潜伏
2560 512 by 512 latents uh for the

350
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,380
训练，
training

351
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:24,660
那么它将开始
then it's gonna go and start the

352
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,540
训练课程，所以
training session so those five those uh

353
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:30,540
2560

354
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:34,560
如果您愿意，这五个 2560 步现在将被压缩
steps if you wish will now be compressed

355
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,760
320，因为在我的情况下，我 我正在使用 8
320 because in my case I'm using eight

356
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,600
um
um

357
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,180
8 平行三治疗，所以我在
eight parallel three healing so I'm kind

358
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,399
of using this option here under the

359
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,139
训练参数下使用这个选项，使批量
training parameters to have like batch

360
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:49,079
大小为 8，这就是为什么这个数字
sizes of eight so that's why this number

361
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:51,660
现在在这里看起来更低，
now is going to look lower in here

362
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:54,120
因为它实际上是在除以这个
because it's actually dividing this

363
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:58,260
总数 呃训练步骤
total number of uh training steps by

364
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:01,500
8 给出 320 现在它
eight which gives 320 and now it's kind

365
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,480
有点缓慢进步并且让你
of slowly progressing and that gives you

366
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,000
了解我在 3090 上获得的速度
an idea of the speed that I get on the

367
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,740
它实际上有点做
3090 it's actually sort of doing

368
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:13,019
1.2 一点我想它可能会
1.2 one point I guess it's probably

369
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:14,519
稳定下来到
going to stabilize down to something

370
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:17,399
类似的东西 1.15 所以它较低，因为我
like 1.15 so that's lower because I'm

371
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:18,899
同时记录了这个，
kind of recording this at the same time

372
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:20,579
但训练即将开始，
but the training is going to get going

373
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:22,260
所以我要暂停这个，然后我将
so I'm going to pause this and then I'm

374
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,760
在训练完成后恢复，
going to resume when the training is

375
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,000
done

376
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:30,720
阿喀琉斯几乎到了 结束
Achilles were almost to the end

377
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,820
所以大约需要 4 分 35
so it took about 4 minutes and 35

378
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,740
秒来
seconds to

379
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,240
完成
complete

380
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,680
整个处理
the full processing

381
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:42,980
，
and

382
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,320
现在它保存了模型，现在它正在将
now it saved the model and now it's

383
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,959
模型转换为安全的舞者，所以
converting the model to a safe dancer so

384
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,820
现在你可以看到它把它保存为一个
now as you can see it saved it as a

385
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,339
保存答案的玻璃杯
glass that saved answers

386
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:56,120
，
and

387
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,839
最后转换保存 保险
finally converting saving the insurance

388
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:03,420
模型，所以我们都完成了，所以现在我们
model so we're all done so now we have

389
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:06,839
the model saved

390
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:10,380
以半精度保存了模型，它实际上也
in half precision and it's actually also

391
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:14,660
有最后一个
has the required last the camel file for

392
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:18,599
auto 实际使用它所需的骆驼文件现在让我们
auto to actually use it now let's give

393
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:20,400
试一试，看看它是否有效，
that a try let's see if it worked

394
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,260
因为那是 整点是对的，我们
because that's the whole point right we

395
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,579
想确保这个模型能正常
want to make sure that this model is

396
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:24,720
工作，所以我要
going to work so I'm going to go and

397
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,339
启动自动，一张一张
fire up Auto one one one

398
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:31,200
到这里到
here into here

399
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,280
网络，
to web

400
00:17:35,299 --> 00:17:38,820
所以让我们真正地一张一张地加载照片
so let's actually load photo one one one

401
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,919
，当它这样做的时候我' 我要去
one and while it does that I'm going to

402
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:42,780
确保模型在
go and make sure the model is in the

403
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:46,559
正确的地方所以让我们去打开
right place so let's go and open up

404
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,400
山的位置所以这里的模型
the mountain location so here model

405
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,200
应该在
should have been put under a quick start

406
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,480
Koya 训练下快速启动因为
under the Koya training because that's

407
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,220
我们把模型放在那里现在可以在
where we put the model is now found

408
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,919
这里找到 在最后一次和最后一次保存
under here under last and last save

409
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:01,799
张量下 所以这是模型
tensor so this is the model

410
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:04,320
是的 更多文件 它在这里如果
yeah more file it goes like this here if

411
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,140
你想使用扩散器版本
you wanted to use the diffuser version

412
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,940
这也是模型的扩散器版本
this is the diffuser version of the

413
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,559
因为我们使用
model as well because we use the

414
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,559
它创建的扩散源
diffuserous source it got created a

415
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:16,559
最初输出或 作为扩散器，
outputted originally or as a diffuser

416
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,380
然后转换为最后保存的
and then converted to a last.saved

417
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:23,280
答案并持续了是的所以我们要去
answer and lasted yeah so we're gonna go

418
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,380
复制这两个东西在这里我要把
and copy those two things here I'm gonna

419
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:28,880
它们转储到我的模型
dump them into my model

420
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,559
文件夹所以模型我要转储它们
folders so models I'm going to dump them

421
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:35,340
让我们创建一个新的 文件夹在这里 新
let's create a new folder here new

422
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,900
文件夹 我们将称之为
folder that we're going to call it

423
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,500
测试
testing

424
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,299
我要去这里 把那两个模型放在
I'm gonna go here put those two models

425
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:44,480
那里 让
there

426
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,880
我们去并在 Auto one 中打开它
and let's go and open that up in Auto

427
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,260
one one

428
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:52,559
我们去这里 让我们开火 让我们
let's go up here let's fire up that

429
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,140
刷新 这样我们就有了 大多数
let's refresh so that we have the most

430
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,240
可用的模型然后让我们来看看
models available and then let's go look

431
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,559
at

432
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:02,340
测试所以测试最后一个让我们说
testing so testing the last let's say

433
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,380
小张量因为你可以看到它
tensor small as you can see it's picked

434
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:07,200
在那里被拾取我们要加载它
up there we're gonna load it

435
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,539
我不记得我们
and I don't remember exactly what we

436
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:12,539
使用的是什么因为
used as the

437
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:15,480
它是 ESD 人所以让我们 去使用
it was ESD person so let's go and use

438
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,340
这两个标记，看看我们是否可以
those two tokens to see if we can

439
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:20,220
从那里生成一些东西，
generate something out of there

440
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:23,760
我们将使用 ESD
we're gonna use ESD

441
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,620
，我们将保留
and we're going to leave the defaults

442
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,059
所有东西的默认值，我们将让它像
for everything we're gonna make it like

443
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:29,760
一批力一样，我们有我的样本，
batch of force we have my sample and

444
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,559
让我们生成 那里有一些东西
let's generate something out of there

445
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,580
我们走了所以我们有四个
there we go so we have the four

446
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:47,220
不同的
different outputs

447
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,440
模型输出我可以向你展示
for the model I can show you the

448
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,840
原始输入看起来
original inputs which appear to match

449
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,080
与预期的
quite well with what was expected to be

450
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,360
训练非常匹配所以这些是实际输出让
trained so those are the actual outputs

451
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,840
我们看看实际输入 所以
and let's look at the actual inputs so

452
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:04,260
这里在每个子集下快速启动，
here under a quick starts under per

453
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:07,559
我们可以看看
under subset and we can look at the

454
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:08,760
实际的，
actual

455
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:12,419
我们将要查看大图标，
we're going to view large icons

456
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:13,080
嗯，
um

457
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:17,640
所以我们喜欢这些典型的图像，所以
so we have like these typicals image so

458
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:22,080
这就是输入的样子
this is what the input is like

459
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,480
，你可以清楚地看到
and you can clearly see that the

460
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,660
结果图像
resulting image are kind of matching the

461
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,799
style

462
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,520
如果我们返回此处，则有点与输入中的样式相匹配，
of what was in the input if we go back

463
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,799
因此您可以看到，如果我们返回
here so you can see that if we go back

464
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:35,880
to

465
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,919
收音机用户界面，
the radio UI

466
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,200
您可以看到
you can see that

467
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,440
我们的结果非常相似，
we have quite similarly looking results

468
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,760
因此可以得出
so

469
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,580
如何实际使用
that concludes how you can actually use

参数 选择
parameters select your actual model that

473
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:04,080
您想要训练的实际模型，然后简单地
you want to train into and then simply

474
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,000
训练您的模型直到
train your model up to the point where

475
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,919
