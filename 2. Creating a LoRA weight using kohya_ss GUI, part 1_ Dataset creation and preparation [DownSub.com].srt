1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,319
所以欢迎，
so welcome

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:06,480
嗯，今天我将完成
um today I'm going to go through the

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,720
从互联网收集图像
process of collecting image from the

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,519
internet

5
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:14,820
并将它们增强到可以使用
and enhancing them to where you can use

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,880
这些图像创建较低模型的过程，嗯，
those to create a lower model

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:23,880
使用 Koya SS GUI 解决方案，
uh using the Koya SS GUI solution so

8
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,880
这样您就可以实际使用您的模型
that you can actually use your models

9
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,760
自动一对一解决方案
using the auto one one one solution

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,579
所以我想我们可能会
so I guess we maybe it's I'm going to

11
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:35,399
为这个视频制作多个部分
make multiple parts for this video the

12
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:37,860
第一个将是收集
first one is going to be the collection

13
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,559
和准备所有这些
and the preparation for all of those

14
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:41,579
图像
image

15
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:44,399
所以让我们开始
so let's start

16
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,340
所以有人建议也许它会
so someone suggested that maybe it would

17
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,219
是 从 1990 年代开始创建 Jennifer Aniston 模型很有趣，
be interesting to create a Jennifer

18
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:51,379
Aniston model

19
00:00:51,379 --> 00:00:54,960
所以让我们开始
from the 1990s so let's go and let's

20
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,739
收集这些图像，然后
start to collect those image and then

21
00:00:57,739 --> 00:01:00,899
我们将看看我们如何实际处理
we'll see how we actually go and process

22
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:03,300
它们并将它们处理到可用于
them to a point where they are usable to

23
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,220
创建 Laura 的程度
create a Laura

24
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,939
所以让我们去搜索 Jennifer 安妮斯顿
so let's go and search Jennifer Aniston

25
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:10,320
和
and

26
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,320
这里有一大堆我们可以
here's a whole bunch of image we can

27
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,540
select

28
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:18,299
从互联网上选择的图像，通常当我
from the internet and typically when I

29
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:21,900
去的时候，我会尝试找到高分辨率或
go I try to find high resolution or the

30
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,780
最高分辨率的图像，这些图像
highest resolution image possible that

31
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:32,159
至少适合 512 x 5 12 像素
will at least fit a 512 by 5 12 pixel

32
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,119
分辨率，这意味着 512 乘以 512 给出 X
resolution meaning 512 times 512 gives X

33
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:39,180
数 的像素，所以我真的不关心
number of pixels so I don't really care

34
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,520
图像的纵横比，
about the aspect ratio of the image

35
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,079
因为我们将使用像桶一样处理
because we're going to use like

36
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:45,900
bucketing which will take care of any

37
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,479
我们将要使用的任何纵横比，所以我们
aspect ratios we're going to use so we

38
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,100
不必关心保留它们
don't have to care about keeping them

39
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,920
正方形 它们可以是
Square they can be landscape portrait

40
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,820
横向 纵向 正方形或者都很好 所以让我们从
square or it's all fine so let's start

41
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,299
这个开始吧 我猜它的分辨率相当低
with this one it's a fairly I guess low

42
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:02,700
我会以这种方式裁剪它
resolution and I would crop it this way

43
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,540
所以这个可能会很小 它是一个
so this one would probably be small it's

44
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,419
潜在可用的但它有点
a potential usable one but it's kind of

45
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:11,520
柔软 有点像
soft a little bit see it's kind of a

46
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,379
视频捕捉，有点软，所以
video capture it's a little bit soft so

47
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:14,940
它不是最好的，嗯，
it's not the best

48
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,220
uh one to use

49
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,160
这个看起来稍微好一点，但
um this one appears slightly better but

50
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,440
它仍然充满了人工制品，所以
it's still kind full of artifacts so

51
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,340
它不是最好的，嗯，
it's not really the best uh one to use

52
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,160
这个绝对是 软这个
um this one is definitely soft this one

53
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,860
不太好所以我们需要找到
is not as good so we I need to find

54
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,860
大约 16 张好图像这个看起来
about 16 good image this one looks

55
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,260
还不错所以我要把
rather okay so I'm gonna go and drag

56
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,959
它拖到我要创建的文件夹中
that into a folder that I'm going to

57
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,480
以收集所有这些东西
create to collect all of those things

58
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,480
所以我们走吧 并创建一个新文件夹，
so let's go and create a new folder that

59
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,500
我们将其命名为 Jennifer 我
we're going to call Jennifer

60
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,959
知道，
I understand

61
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:54,000
我将在其中创建一个名为
and in there I'm going to create a

62
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,640
image well 的子文件
subfolder called image well first of all

63
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,140
夹
I'm going to create the subfolder called

64
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,480
Lore because I want to create a low run

65
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,120
在那里我要创建一个
and within there I'm going to create a

66
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,300
名为 image 的新文件夹，
new folder called image

67
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,280
在该文件夹中我将
and within that folder I'm going to

68
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,340
创建另一个名为
create yet another subfolder called

69
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:14,159
number of repeats 的子文件夹，我打算
number of repeats that I intend to run

70
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,519
在 16 幅图像上运行，我通常会重复 100 次
so on 16 image I usually do 100 repeats

71
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,379
图像作为一部分 较低的
of the image as part of the lower

72
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:22,140
交易，在这里我要称呼它为
trading and here I'm going to call that

73
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,879
詹妮弗，
Jennifer

74
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:26,280
所以我首先知道这个文件夹中有哪些图片，所以
so I know what pictures are in this

75
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,300
folder

76
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,739
the first

77
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:30,840
现在我终于可以打开那个文件夹了，
so now finally I can open up that folder

78
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,000
现在我们可以开始了，所以我要
and now we're good to start so I'm going

79
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,860
移动那个 稍微在这里所以我
to move that slightly here so what I'm

80
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,480
要做的是我只是去点击
going to do is I'm just going to go and

81
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,360
并将这张图片拖到我的文件夹中
click and drag this image into my folder

82
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,819
所以现在我们有了第一张图片
so now we have the first image there

83
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:44,640
现在让我们继续四处寻找好的
now let's keep fishing around for good

84
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,060
图片我正在使用谷歌 现在
image to use I'm using Google right now

85
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,400
在某个时候，如果我找不到质量好的图像，我可能会切换到 Bing
at some point I may switch to Bing if I

86
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,000
这个
don't find a good quality image this one

87
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,019
看起来
looks

88
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:58,080
不错所以这是一个很好的分辨率图像
good so that's a good resolution image

89
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,159
2000 像素 x 3000 像素所以这很好
2000 pixel by 3000 pixel so that's good

90
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,920
所以让我们将它拖到
so let's drag that into

91
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,920
目的地
the destination

92
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,319
并让我们找到更多图像
and let's find more image

93
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,720
1990 年代还有什么好东西
what else could be good from the 1990s

94
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,299
这个看起来不错它是公认的
this one looks good it's well recognized

95
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:18,418
图像分辨率相当低但我们会在
image rather low in resolution but we'll

96
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:21,899
我们在那里处理它
deal with it once we are there

97
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:23,100
嗯
um

98
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,199
还有什么可能我不会捕捉
what else maybe I'm not going to capture

99
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,540
选择图像和增强的整个过程
the whole process of selecting image and

100
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,639
他们但是
enhancing them but

101
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:30,600
um

102
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,680
这个图像看起来不错所以我们也要
this image looks okay so we're gonna

103
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,300
坚持那个
stick with that one too

104
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,499
[音乐]
[Music]

105
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,380
那个看起来不错
that one looks good

106
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,699
所以我有点试图改变姿势风格
so I'm kind of trying to vary the pose

107
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:50,699
the style the

108
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:53,520
面部的嗯角度从
um angles of the face to have like from

109
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,740
像这个一样 不错，因为我们有
like this one is not bad because we have

110
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,440
类似的上半身镜头，这是一个
like kind of upper body shot which is a

111
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,759
很好的方法，因为我们需要其中
good way because we're going to need

112
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,699
一些让模型学习，
some of those for the model to learn

113
00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:04,380
比如除了脸部和
like Beyond just the face and the

114
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,060
肩膀，我们还需要学习
shoulders we need to kind of learn what

115
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,100
模型的外观 嗯，还有
the model looks like

116
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,960
um

117
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,620
什么我们可以看看这个
what else could we look at this one

118
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,900
分辨率相当低的它
that's a fairly low resolution it's too

119
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:19,560
太低了，比如 2 273 x 364。它不会
low like 2 273 by by 364. it wouldn't

120
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,199
与那个一起工作我想我们已经在相似的脸上看到了这个是的，
work with that I think we have seen this

121
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:25,979
one above similar looking face

122
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:28,560
但我不认为 我们有它所以我
yeah but I don't think we have it so I

123
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,600
认为这可能是一个很好的上半身
think that could be a good upper body

124
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,460
拍摄类型的
shot type

125
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,780
图像
image

126
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,979
让我们将它拖到那里
let's drag it there

127
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,720
其他一切都好所以这个是
everything else okay so this one is

128
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,660
不同的空气风格
different air Style

129
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,740
可以正常工作
that will work

130
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,220
它有点暗
okay that's a bit dark

131
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,600
嗯
um that could

132
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,400
现在分辨率太低我们
now the resolution is too low we

133
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,380
不会' 无法裁剪它并获得良好的
wouldn't be able to crop it and get good

134
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,419
结果我不会坚持使用
results I'm not going to stick with that

135
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:01,440
one

136
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,680
那个分辨率相当低的那个 2 并且
this one fairly low resolution 2 and the

137
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,680
东西已经很好而且这很好
thing already good and this well there

138
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,560
这里可能有一个很好的
could be a good one here

139
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,620
所以让我们选择那个
so let's pick that one

140
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,380
还有什么 这个表面是否有任何
what else is there does that surface any

141
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:19,280
好的图像
good image

142
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,880
让我们寻找更多
let's look for more

143
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:32,460
寻找不同风格的
looking at finding different style

144
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:37,039
不同爪子姿势我想
different Paws poses I guess

145
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,479
它有点柔软但它是
it's kind of soft soft-ish but it's kind

146
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,419
一种不同的姿势让我们尝试使用
of a different pose let's try to work

147
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:47,759
它让我们把它带到这里我们会看到
with it let's bring it here we'll see

148
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,280
多远 我们可以增强它，也许可以
how far we can enhance it to maybe able

149
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,220
利用它
to make use of it

150
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:52,680
[音乐]
[Music]

151
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,680
嗯，
um

152
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,720
这个
this one

153
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,520
不错的
not bad

154
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,800
分辨率有点低，但我们
resolution is a little low but well we

155
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,300
可以通过 Uprising 来解决这个问题，
can deal with that

156
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,120
with Uprising it

157
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,240
嗯，
um

158
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:20,099
就像穿着泳衣一样，
so there's that like in a bathing suit

159
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:23,220
詹妮弗安妮斯顿看起来真的很像
is that really Jennifer Aniston looks

160
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,960
喜欢
like er

161
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,720
那种不同的风格，我想
kind of different style I guess it could

162
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,900
我们可以把它穿成
we could bring it in

163
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,780
不同的衣服，不同的风格，这
different clothing different style this

164
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,819
是两张照片，另一张不是
one is two pictures and one that's not

165
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:38,520
我们想要的，
what we want

166
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,580
um

167
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,580
嗯，在列表中，
kind of going down the list here

168
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:50,960
这张照片不错，
this one is not bad

169
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,479
所以我们有多少 现在我们最多
so how many do we have now we are up to

170
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,180
13 岁。所以我们还需要三张三张更多的
13. so we need three more three more

171
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,160
照片我倾向于坚持 16 张
pictures I tend to stick with 16

172
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,919
照片所以这一张很好
pictures so this one is good

173
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,860
现在我们是 14 岁。
now we're 14.

174
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,960
有点像这张
kind of this

175
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,340
14 15 的照片，
snap 14 15 and what else she looks older

176
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,740
我猜她在这张照片上还有什么看起来更老
on this one I guess

177
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,500
我不知道这是否是一个不错的选择，
I don't know if it's a good choice or

178
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,360
但
not but

179
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:22,020
我有点想建立一个 1990 年代
I'm kind of trying to build a 1990s

180
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,759
风格的模型，
style model

181
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,740
呃，不是
uh not a

182
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:29,699
最近的两个版本，所以有点保持
two recent version so kind of keeping

183
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:31,039
the same

184
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,860
相同的年龄或时代啊，
the same age or era

185
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,860
ah

186
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:42,059
是的，它有点暗，而且
yeah it's a little bit dark and

187
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:45,540
这个现在太软了，
what about this one now too soft

188
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:49,200
我想不是真正的 1990，所以让我们
and I guess not not really 1990 so let's

189
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,640
选择大的
go with big

190
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,140
哦，让我们看看我们是否可以在
oh let's see if we can find something

191
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,660
某个时候找到其他东西当我们选择一些
else sometime when we select some of the

192
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,100
顶级图像时
top image

193
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,019
我们可以
we can get

194
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:03,180
other

195
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:06,959
在这里得到其他的这个看起来不错我
ones here this one looks pretty good I

196
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,660
不 不认为我们已经有了那个，所以
don't think we've got that one yet so

197
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,640
现在我们已经下降到 60。好吧，让我们
now we're down to 60. okay so let's

198
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,380
继续吧，就像它不需要
let's go with that like it doesn't need

199
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,300
完美一样，我们可以坚持下去，所以
to be perfect we can stick with that so

200
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,660
现在我们有 16 个图像，我们 可以
now we have our 16 image here and we can

201
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,060
在超大图标中查看它们，这样我们就可以
view them in extra large icons so we can

202
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,600
啊，也许我已经得到了两次 不，
ah maybe I've got this one twice no no

203
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,300
没关系，一切都很好，所以现在让我们开始
okay it's all fine so now let's start

204
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,360
处理这些问题，所以我
the processing aspect of those so what I

205
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,380
倾向于做的是，我通常会启动
tend to do is I usually go in fire up

206
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:37,140
十亿像素以进行排序 帮助
gigapixel to kind of help with the

207
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,660
提升所有这些图像所以让我们
upresing of all of those image so let's

208
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,740
开始 gigapixel
start gigapixel

209
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,500
我要做的是我将
and what I'm going to do is I'm going to

210
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,920
去拖动每个图像所以让我们
go and drag each of those image so let's

211
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,440
选择第一个我将把它拖到
pick the first one I'm going to drag it

212
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,500
这里 现在你可以看到这是一个
in here and now as you can see this is a

213
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,779
相当低的哇我没有意识到它是
fairly low wow I didn't realize it was

214
00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:02,700
这个 308 x 383 像素的小图像
this little 308 by 383 pixel uh image

215
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,580
实际上非常小是
that's actually shockingly small is it

216
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,140
因为我
because I picked it up from the wrong

217
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,300
在选择图像时从错误的地方拾取它让我们
place when I selected my image let's

218
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,040
仔细检查 这是因为它
double check this because it's

219
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,380
太低了
suspiciously low

220
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:17,240
我从哪里选的 是的
where did I pick this one from

221
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:22,500
here

222
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,839
它不应该更大 让
yeah it shouldn't have been larger

223
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:28,320
我们看看我是否再次将它拖到这里然后
let's see if I drag it here again

224
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,000
我现在更换它
and I replace it

225
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,940
也许它只是给我一个
now maybe it's just giving me a

226
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,440
不是真正
resolution that is not the true

227
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,320
分辨率的分辨率所以让我们放弃 这个
resolution so let's ditch this one close

228
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,000
没有保存就关闭了，
without saving

229
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,040
让我们把它放回这里，
let's bring it back here

230
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,100
这次我们的分辨率更高，
and we're at a better resolution this

231
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,839
所以稍微好一点，
time so it's kind of a little bit better

232
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:52,140
但我喜欢使用千兆像素来
but I like to kind of use gigapixel to

233
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:55,339
查看效果如何哦，
see how kind of

234
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,680
因为我的默认设置是
oh it's because my default is is down to

235
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,899
向下采样所以让我们实际把它带到
down sample so let's actually bring it

236
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:02,940
这里所以现在我可以并排制作它
here so now I can make it side by side

237
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,579
现在你可以查看它之前和之后现在让我们
so now you can view it before and after

238
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:09,720
把它放在 100 分辨率
now it let's put it at 100 resolution

239
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,600
所以现在你可以看到它如何澄清
so now you can see how it clarifies the

240
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,140
实际的前后图像
actual before and after image

241
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:19,320
所以我 我要去把它保存
so I'm gonna go and save that

242
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,320
为第一张图片
as the first image

243
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,380
好吧现在让我们带来第二张所以
okay now let's bring the second so what

244
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,839
它在这里做了什么它有点去创建
it does here it kind of goes and creates

245
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,720
一个新版本就像缩放 X2
a new version of that like with scale X2

246
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,279
所以我通常去删除原始
so I usually go and delete the original

247
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:34,800
图像并保持缩放 在这里，
image and keep the scaled one here so

248
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,839
现在我要为每张图片继续这样做，
now I'm gonna keep doing that for every

249
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:38,640
image

250
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,620
所以现在这一张，正如你所看到的，它
so this one now as you can see it's

251
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:43,200
已经使图像更清晰了，所以
already making the image much clearer so

252
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,240
我们要保存
we're gonna save that

253
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,540
我们将使用呃在这种情况下
we're going to use the uh in this case

254
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,120
我是 将指定 jpeg，因为它是
I'm going to specify jpeg because it's a

255
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,540
一个 webp 图像，如果您
it's a it's a webp image and if you

256
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,760
不选择 jpeg，它会将其保存
don't select jpeg it's going to save it

257
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,740
为 tiff，并且
as a tiff and that doesn't work too well

258
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,959
创建 Laura 效果不佳，所以现在完成了，让我们
to create the Laura so now that's done

259
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,600
let's bring the

260
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,339
开始吧 并删除
let's go and delete

261
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:07,260
好让我们把所有的想法都带来让我们
well let's bring me with all the ideas

262
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:10,200
let's bring the other picture in

263
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,140
现在把另一张图片带进来，你可以看到之前和之后它
now as you can see before and after it's

264
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:16,940
肯定更好所以让我们保存
definitely better so let's save

265
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,620
继续前进
move on

266
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,380
所以让我们把所有的东西都带进来所以
so let's I'll bring all of them in so

267
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,600
我们有一个快速的交易所以 我将
that we have one quick deal so I'm going

268
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,640
带来我们目前拥有的所有不同图像，
to bring all of the different image

269
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,680
that we have so far

270
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,600
and

271
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,060
正如您所看到的，它在澄清方面做得相当不错，而
as you can see it does a fairly decent

272
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,160
不是
job at clarifying so instead of going

273
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,040
一张一张地尝试查看
one by one and trying to kind of look at

274
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,779
所有图像，我是 只是去
all of the image I'm just going to go

275
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:42,600
批量转换它们
and batch convert them

276
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,920
嗯
um

277
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,899
所以这里有几张图片，
so there's a couple of image here that

278
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:46,860
uh

279
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,200
嗯是的我可能必须一张一张地看这个
yeah I might have to go one by one this

280
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,180
我们已经完成了所以我想现在
one we've already done so I think now

281
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,880
我们已经完成了第四张，也就是
we're done down to the fourth which is

282
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,560
这张 所以我很好，我们将保存
this one so I'm good we're gonna save

283
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,899
这张与
this image

284
00:12:56,899 --> 00:13:00,720
Source 相同的图像，从旁边转到这里，
same as Source kind of going here on the

285
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,060
看看
side and looking at

286
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:06,600
它是哪一张，所以它是 Web P 还是
which one it is so is it a web P that's

287
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,300
JPEG，没问题我们可以保留让我们看看
a JPEG that's fine we can Preserve

288
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,740
这个
let's look at this one

289
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,060
哦 根本没有太大变化
oh it doesn't change at all that much

290
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:22,620
它仍然相当模糊我想这是
it's still fairly fuzzy I guess that's a

291
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,779
图像的局限性我们将
limitation of the image well we're going

292
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:26,459
看看我们是否可以做一些事情
to see if we can do something about that

293
00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:27,560
after

294
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:32,420
无论如何让我们现在增强它
anyway let's enhance it for now

295
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:36,420
这是一个相当高分辨率的图像
this is a fairly high resolution image

296
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:40,459
我们应该 不需要用它做太多是的
we shouldn't need to do too much with it

297
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:43,800
它实际上并没有做太多
yeah it doesn't actually do much with

298
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,660
所以我们将跳过下
that so we're gonna skip over

299
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,880
一个它是一个相当大的分辨率
next one it's a fairly large resolution

300
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,380
所以我们甚至不要在这个上工作
so let's not even work on this one

301
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:58,040
呃这个
uh this one

302
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:04,920
我们要走了 裁剪它因为它有点太紧太
we're gonna go and crop it because it's

303
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,320
宽所以对于
a little bit too tight too wide so for

304
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,139
我想去的主题并裁剪
the subject I want to go and crop all of

305
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:12,959
我的所有图像以将
my image to kind of focus all of the

306
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,779
培训师的所有注意力集中在
attention of the trainer on the subject

307
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:17,399
我正在尝试训练的主题上你不
that I'm trying to train you don't

308
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:19,740
真的很关心
really care about the rest of the stuff

309
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,959
她周围的其他东西，我最重要的
around her and what I what what matters

310
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:25,680
是这个主题看起来不错所以现在我们
is that the subject looks good so now we

311
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,019
要保存它所以我
have we're going to save that so I

312
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:30,060
现在几乎不得不回去裁剪所有
almost have now to go back and crop all

313
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,399
其他的因为我忘记了
the other ones because I forgot to

314
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:33,480
实际上
actually

315
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,399
对所有其他的都这样做所以让我们
do that for all the other ones so let's

316
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:38,100
回到第一个这里让我们裁剪
go back here on the first one let's crop

317
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,320
它因为周围有一些我不关心的东西
it because there is stuff I don't care

318
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,980
about around

319
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,839
现在我实际上可以看到这个图像
and now I can actually see this image

320
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:54,180
但它有点失败因为我想我
and it kind of fails because I guess I

321
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:57,240
更换了 原来
replaced the original

322
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,820
的 2x 所以我想我必须
with the 2x so I guess I would have to

323
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,620
去删除那个并带回
go and delete that one and bring back

324
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,940
the

325
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,779
我已经拥有的高档版本
upscale version that I've already got

326
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:08,040
现在我将继续并
and now I'm just going to go ahead and

327
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,579
裁剪它
crop that

328
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:13,199
所以你可以看到它可以是
so as you can see it can be a little bit

329
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,740
这样做有点乏味，但
of a tedious work to do that but it's

330
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,440
值得删除和调整
well worth dropping and adjusting

331
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,839
所有内容，这样可以保存图像，所以
everything so saving the image

332
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,380
现在这个是什么，所以我们需要
okay so now what is this one so we need

333
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,180
处理那个，所以让我们先裁剪它，
to deal with that one so let's crop it

334
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,680
这样我们就可以继续了 并
first so we're going to go ahead and

335
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,839
裁剪到这一点，所以我们尽可能多地保留
crop to this point so we keep as much as

336
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,320
原始图像，
the original image as possible

337
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,420
所以现在我们有更好的
so now we have a better

338
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:44,000
裁剪效果，所以让我们保存图像，
crop so let's save the image

339
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,100
嗯，好吧，
um okay

340
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,320
那么这个呢，所以我们
so what about this one so this one we

341
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,720
可以稍微裁剪一下
can crop slightly

342
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,959
复制废话，我想我不 我真的不
copy crap here I guess I don't really

343
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,959
关心部分裁剪，
care about the part crop

344
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:01,399
现在
and now save

345
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:06,120
在这里保存同样的东西肯定有
same thing here there's definitely a lot

346
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,800
很多裁剪需要进行
of cropping that needs to take place

347
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:12,620
我们将在这里裁剪在那里裁剪
we're going to crop here crop there

348
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:16,860
然后我们将结果保存
and then we're gonna save the resulting

349
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,880
到 X 版本
to X version

350
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:24,420
这个呃我们 有点已经做了
this one uh as we sort of already did it

351
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:27,120
它已经按照我们想要的方式裁剪了所以
it's already cropped as we want so and

352
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,100
我们需要进入并使用这个
we need to go in and work with this one

353
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:34,560
让我们看看那个裁剪明智它
let's look at that one cropping wise it

354
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,000
看起来不错
looks good

355
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,639
所以我认为分辨率明智我们已经
so I think resolution wise we're already

356
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,800
非常好所以不需要真正抓住
pretty good so no need to really grip

357
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,839
我会按下它，所以这是一个 webp
I'll press that so this one is a webp

358
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:44,220
我们需要注意
we're gonna need to watch out a little

359
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,899
一点，确保我们将它保存为裁剪后的
bit for it make sure we save it as a

360
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:47,160
jpeg，
jpeg

361
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,399
所以我总是留下
cropped around so I always leave a

362
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,500
一点边框，因为分桶
little bit of a border because bucketing

363
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,720
实际上是要 去
is actually going to go and change

364
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,180
稍微改变或稍微损坏以适应
slightly or corrupt slightly to fit

365
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:01,620
within a 64 pixel by 64 pixel limits

366
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:05,280
分辨率内的 64 像素 x 64 像素限制，这样可以给我
within the resolution so that gives me

367
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,400
一些游乐场，而不会在它
some playground without losing too much

368
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,780
of the subject when it's going to do

369
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,299
要这样做或是否必须这样做时丢失太多主题所以让我们
that or if it has to do that

370
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:14,579
看看是否 这不是太大没关系好吧
so let's see if this isn't too big it's

371
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:17,480
fine okay

372
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:23,099
下一个是这个我们已经完成
next one is this one we've already done

373
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:25,740
了所以不需要重做
it so no need to redo it

374
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,260
下一个是一个
next one is

375
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,840
小的
that one that's a small one

376
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,000
肯定需要
definitely need to

377
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,740
升级所以
upres that so

378
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,679
所以这个我们要走了
so this one we're gonna go and

379
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,340
放下它
drop it

380
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,820
好吧我们要保存它
okay we're gonna save it

381
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,980
这个
this one

382
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,919
我们可以裁剪顶部的尖刺所以我们真的不会
we can crop the top spiky so we don't

383
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,340
让所有的东西都
really keep all of that stuff cracked a

384
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,280
向右裂开一点
little bit to the right

385
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,960
好吧保存图像
okay save the image

386
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:23,179
这个很多裁剪
this one lots of cropping to do

387
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:39,600
做好这个看起来 相当大，除非我
okay this one looks fairly big unless I

388
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,220
需要购买 是的，我需要裁剪它 是的，其中
need to buy yeah I need to crop it

389
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,780
一些非常大，我的意思是
yeah some of those are very big I mean

390
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:00,660
我们不需要那么大的图像，呃，
we don't need that big of an image uh

391
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,400
这个希望将从
this one hopefully will benefit a lot

392
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,240
裁剪和起义中受益匪浅，但
from cropping and from Uprising but

393
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,299
我不 知道我们会看看我是否裁剪它
I don't know we'll see if I crop it what

394
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:10,980
之前和之后的样子
does it look like before and after

395
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,200
没什么不同 几乎在它
nothing much different

396
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,260
并排之后看起来更糟
almost looks worse after it's been

397
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:19,500
嗯，也许是因为我 50 岁，
abreast uh maybe it's because I'm at 50

398
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,380
如果我去 100 是的，
if I go to 100

399
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,000
yeah

400
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,919
让事情更清楚一点
kind of make things a little bit clearer

401
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,960
但它有点带出噪音
but it kind of brings out the noise

402
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,620
也许我可以消除这里设置中的更多噪音
maybe I can remove the bit more noise in

403
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:34,740
the the setting here

404
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,679
我不知道
I don't know that it does much

405
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,940
如果我将它推到最大它会起到多大作用
if I push it to the max

406
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,280
确实有点帮助我们会
kind of does help a little bit we'll

407
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,900
我们会的 继续吧，我们将不得不
we'll go with that we'll we'll have to

408
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,820
稍微修改一下它，它有点像
rework that one a little bit it's kind

409
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,440
of

410
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,460
在丑陋的一面构建它，所以
build it on the ugly side so this one

411
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,620
我认为它是腐败的，而
I think it's corrupt right and the

412
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:59,220
这个的解决方案是什么，是
resolution for this one was what for was

413
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:03,980
的，我想它不是 很好，
yeah I guess it's well not good

414
00:20:05,179 --> 00:20:08,160
这个非常好，
this one very good

415
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,840
不需要裁剪
no need to crop

416
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,240
保存它
save it

417
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,940
和最后一个，
and final one

418
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,980
因为我们已经这样做了，所以我们不需要
as we already did so we don't need to

419
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:20,220
重做那个好吧，所以现在我们应该拥有我们
redo that one okay so now we should have

420
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,700
在 Upper upres 版本中需要的几乎所有图像，
pretty much all the image we need in

421
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,640
所以现在让我们把
Upper upres versions so now let's bring

422
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,220
那个 让我们清理
that up and let's clean up the content

423
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,840
文件夹的内容
of the folder

424
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,140
所以我们不关心那个图像现在我们
so we don't care about that image now we

425
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,940
只想要裁剪版本所以我们
just wanted the crop version so we're

426
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:39,000
要删除这两个在这里我
going to delete those two and here I

427
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,980
真的不关心这些我
don't really care about these ones I

428
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,840
想要裁剪 这是最后
want the crop version which is this last

429
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,299
一个版本所以让我们把
one so let's take those

430
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:49,919
那个放大了两倍我猜它并
uh this one scaled twice I guess it

431
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,660
没有真正使它成为一个巨大的
didn't really make like that's a huge

432
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,539
图像它对外观和感觉没有太大帮助
image it didn't help much with the look

433
00:20:54,539 --> 00:20:55,980
所以我们将删除
and feel so we're just going to delete

434
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:58,260
放大的那个 这个我们没有
the upscaled one this one we didn't

435
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,179
升级它已经足够大了这个
upscale it's already big enough this one

436
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:03,240
我们做了所以这个我们放弃了这个我们做了
we did so this one we dropped

437
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:07,440
什么让我们看看
this one we did what let's see double

438
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,320
双双交换比例版本这是
double swap scale version this is the

439
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,820
旧的
old one

440
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:15,780
webp 删除这个是招募
webp delete this one was the recruit

441
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:18,299
版本这个被裁剪得很好 这个是
version this one was pretty cropped this

442
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:21,000
歌剧，
one was operas

443
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,700
这个是并排的，
this one was abreast

444
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:28,320
这个是 web P 我们去掉了，
and this one was web P we get rid of

445
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,059
所以这个可能被压了，
so this one was maybe get a pressed

446
00:21:32,059 --> 00:21:34,860
我想我们去掉了这个，
and I guess we get rid of this one

447
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,960
因为它被裁剪了，所以现在我们有
because it was cropped so now we have

448
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,700
16 张图像
the 16 image

449
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,940
准备好了 去吧，但有一
kind of ready to go but there's one

450
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,520
件事可以做，其中一些看起来
thing that could be done some of them

451
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,799
很糟糕，如果我们
may look fairly bad like if we look at

452
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:50,700
在这里看它们，这个看起来很锋利，所以
them in here this one looks sharp so no

453
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,640
不需要做任何事情，这个看起来锋利
need to do anything this one looks sharp

454
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,520
锋利，这个很软，所以这个可能
sharp this one is soft so this one could

455
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:00,240
需要一些返工
need some rework and what I tend to try

456
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,179
在这种情况下，我倾向于尝试做的是返回
to do in this case is I go back

457
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:09,240
并启动 Koya SS GUI
and I fire up the Koya SS GUI

458
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,440
我已经在访问方式中安装了它，因此
I've installed it in way access so

459
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,280
启动了 gooey ear gui.ps1
firing up the gooey ear gui.ps1

460
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,460
外部
foreign

461
00:22:20,659 --> 00:22:24,299
扩散实际上帮助我
diffusion to actually help me

462
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:27,179
清理了一些 这些图像实际上
clean up some of those image actually

463
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,039
不是钱不想要这个我
not that money don't want this one I

464
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,240
想
want to

465
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,419
用一个一个一个
use out of one one one

466
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:35,659
所以
so

467
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:41,520
也许让我们看看是否有任何新东西
maybe let's see if there's anything new

468
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,860
哦是的有一些更新
oh and yes there are some updates

469
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:50,780
让我们启动网络用户界面
let's fire up the web UI

470
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:04,580
嗯
hmm

471
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:14,539
需要一点时间来开始
takes a little while to start

472
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,100
希望 对于我为
hopefully with everything that I'm

473
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,320
音频和屏幕
running for the audio and the screen

474
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,820
截图运行的所有内容，它不会使
capture it's not going to make the

475
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:21,679
系统
system

476
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,039
过载但
overloaded but

477
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,820
应该没问题所以让我们放慢
should okay so let's Slow it Up

478
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:33,240
速度自动一对一网络用户界面我
the auto one one one web UI and what I'm

479
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,640
要做的是进入图像 图像
going to do is go into image to image

480
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,760
，我将去删除
and I'm going to go and drop a copy of

481
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,760
我想要更改的图像的副本，所以
that image that I want to change so what

482
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,640
我倾向于坚持使用最大
I tend to do is stick with a maximum

483
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,679
分辨率，在这种情况下它高于
resolution in this case it's higher than

484
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:49,559
宽度，所以我将使用 1 10 24
width so I'm going to go with 1 10 24

485
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:51,900
然后我将宽度调整到
and then I adjust the width up to a

486
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,000
适合分辨率的点
point where it kind of fits within the

487
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,340
所以现在我们有一个很好的适合我
resolution so now we have a nice fit I'm

488
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,440
将运行剪辑询问以获得对
going to run clip interrogate to get

489
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,380
kind of a nice

490
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:05,720
图像是什么的很好的描述
description of what the image is

491
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:10,919
并且
and

492
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:13,860
很可能 圣经
it's quite likely that there's already a

493
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:17,039
中已经有一些关于詹妮弗安妮斯顿的知识，
some knowledge of Jennifer Aniston in

494
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:21,080
所以我要
the Bible so I'm going to invoke

495
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,640
for Aniston

496
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,539
在描述中引用安妮斯顿，我要做的
in the description and what I'm gonna do

497
00:24:27,539 --> 00:24:31,080
是将去噪强度保持在
is kind of keep the denoising strength

498
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:35,100
相当低的水平，比如 30%，所以它是
fairly low like at 30 percent so it's a

499
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:39,720
0.3 的值，我 我要请求
0.3 value and I'm going to ask for a

500
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,880
picture to picture

501
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:46,559
该图像的图片到图片的再现所以它所做的
rendition of that image so what that did

502
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,679
是
is it kind of

503
00:24:48,679 --> 00:24:51,900
重新构想它根据此处的描述重新构想该图像
reimagined it reimagined this image

504
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,299
based on the description here

505
00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:58,260
并且它将创建该图像的清晰版本，
and it will create a crispr version of

506
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,360
它看起来仍然很像
this image that still looks a lot like

507
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,220
原始图像 现在你必须
the original now you have to kind of

508
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,919
比较一下，从外观的角度来看，这个版本是否可以接受，
compare it is this version acceptable

509
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:08,700
所以如果我把
from a look perspective so if I bring

510
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,159
原来的版本带到这里，我们把
the original one here and we kind of

511
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:13,799
它们像那样带来，然后我把它缩小，
bring them like that and I scale it down

512
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:15,900
这样我们就有了一种更接近
so we have like a kind of closer

513
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,960
匹配的分辨率，
matching resolution

514
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,919
嗯，
um

515
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,720
怎么做 他们比较
how do they compare

516
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,419
好我认为眼睛耳朵有点
well I think the eye ear is a little bit

517
00:25:24,419 --> 00:25:27,480
时髦我认为允许
funky I think the strength of allowing

518
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,179
软件重新想象
the software to kind of re-imagine that

519
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:32,039
图像的强度有点太强了所以让
image is a little bit too strong so

520
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:34,080
我们回过头来将
let's go back and let's change that

521
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,500
去噪罢工更改为大概 20 以便
denoising strike to maybe 20 so to limit

522
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:41,279
真正限制软件可以做什么
really what the software can do

523
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:42,419
um
um

524
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:44,460
所以它会减少它的改变但它
so it's going to change it less but it's

525
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,960
看起来更像原始
going to look more like the original

526
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,279
模型
model

527
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,559
我可以做的事情因为现在我有
something I can do because now I've got

528
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:52,740
低去噪罢工是我要
the low denoising strike is I'm going to

529
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:53,940
提高
raise

530
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:56,880
实际的采样步骤 更高的
the actual sampling steps to higher

531
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,880
采样步骤以获得更好的结果并将
sampling steps to get better results and

532
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:03,419
采样方法更改为 DPM
change also the sampling method to DPM

533
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:06,299
plus sde 相机，
plus plus sde cameras

534
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:09,720
这往往会产生更好的输出所以
which tend to produce better outputs so

535
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,419
希望
hopefully with that

536
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:17,520
我们会得到一个更好的版本
we're gonna get a much nicer version of

537
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,240
uh 改进的稳定扩散
the uh of the improved stable diffusion

538
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,220
版本 原始图像
version of the original image

539
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:26,400
所以现在眼睛看起来
so now the eyes look a little bit better

540
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,440
比以前好一点
than they used to

541
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:34,620
它不那么柔软它仍然不是很
it's not as soft it's still not very

542
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:37,500
锐利但
sharp but

543
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:41,820
嗯它确实略有改善我猜
um it does improve slightly and I guess

544
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:44,039
分辨率错误是的所以
the resolution the errors and yeah so

545
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:45,480
我们会坚持下去所以我 我
we're gonna stick with that so what I'm

546
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,640
现在要做的是
going to do now is I'm just going to go

547
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,460
回到我的 Jennifer Aniston
back into my Jennifer Aniston

548
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,900
文件夹，
folder

549
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,059
然后将
here and I'm just going to go and drag

550
00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:56,340
这张图片拖回那里，然后
this image back in there and I'm going

551
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,960
删除
to go and delete

552
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:01,020
副本，这样原来的就可以了 版本
the duplicate so that original version

553
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,760
不见了，现在我要保留
is gone and now I'm going to keep that

554
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,799
那个，所以让我们继续看另一张
one so let's keep looking at the other

555
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,200
图片，
image

556
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:10,559
这个看起来不错，但是
this one is sort of looking good but

557
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,419
是的，我想我们会保留它，因为
yeah I guess we're gonna keep it as is

558
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:16,559
这个很安全，这个很好
this one is safety good this one is good

559
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,539
这个 一个很好，一个很好，一个
this one is good that one's good that

560
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:21,360
很好，可以正常工作，一个
one's fine that works okay that one is

561
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,340
绝对不好，
definitely bad

562
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,320
嗯，让我们尝试改进这个，
um let's try to improve this one

563
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:29,580
所以我将再次回到这里进入
so I'm going to go back here again into

564
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:33,059
主要扩散或白色 UI 将
staple diffusion or the white UI drag

565
00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:35,400
图像拖动到这里然后我们是 将
the image here and then we're going to

566
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,640
尺寸调整到最合适所以
go in size it to be the best fit so

567
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,400
我们要去这里我们有点
we're gonna go to here we're kind of

568
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,659
失去
losing

569
00:27:42,659 --> 00:27:45,740
part of

570
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,299
头部或者我宁愿
the heads or I'm gonna I would rather

571
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:50,400
失去侧面的一些东西而不是
lose some things on the side than

572
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,320
高度的东西
something on the height of the of the

573
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,980
井的也许我会失去一些头
well maybe I could lose some of the head

574
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:58,559
它不是那么糟糕我想我会
it's not so bad I guess I'm going to

575
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,840
坚持那个现在我们要
stick with that one and now we're going

576
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,240
重新运行审讯剪辑所以我
to go and rerun interrogate clip so I'm

577
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,919
要继续复制 在这里命名
just going to go ahead and copy the name

578
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:05,820
here

579
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,980
他们是 eclip 以获得更
they're eclip to get a description

580
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:12,080
接近图像的描述
closer to what the image is about

581
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:18,860
，现在我们将要求
first and now we're going to ask for a

582
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:23,900
重新创建该图像
re creation of that image

583
00:28:35,539 --> 00:28:38,360
所以现在我们肯定有一个大大
so now we have definitely a much

584
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:42,000
改进的版本，
improved version of the noisy image that

585
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,520
我们从开始的嘈杂图像 所以绝对是一个
we started from so definitely an

586
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,620
改进，所以我们要坚持并
improvement so we're gonna stick and

587
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:49,380
保留那个图像，而不是
keep that image instead of the noisy one

588
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:52,919
我们添加的嘈杂图像，我们甚至可以尝试
that we add well we could even try to

589
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:55,080
使用更好的改进，
play with even better Improvement right

590
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:58,799
这样我就可以尝试 25
that was that so I could maybe try at 25

591
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,720
% 的
percent

592
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,020
去噪强度
denoising strength

593
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,120
，让我们看看 如果拍摄
and let's see what it gives us if the

594
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,480
对象看起来仍然像原来的那样，这会给我们带来
subject still looks like the original

595
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,380
什么，这才是最重要的，
that's what that's what matters

596
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,059
尤其是面部，这是我们
especially the face right that's what we

597
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:14,940
最关心的，面部看起来
care the most about that the face looks

598
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:17,279
仍然像同一种微笑，
still like the same kind of smile and

599
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:20,039
鼻子和眼睛，
nose and eyes

600
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:22,140
如果它们变得太不同的话，它 有点
if they get too different and it kind of

601
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:24,419
破坏了实际的模型，所以这个现在
breaks the actual model so this one now

602
00:29:24,419 --> 00:29:26,460
看起来不错，
looks pretty good

603
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:29,520
所以我认为我们可以使用那个模型，
so I think we are okay to use that one

604
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,980
所以现在您对
so now you have a feel for what is the

605
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,679
从互联网引入图像的工作流程有什么感觉，
workflow to bring in image from the

606
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:38,520
这可能不够好，也可能不够
internet that may or may not be uh

607
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:42,360
好 使用然后
good enough to use and then kind of uh

608
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:45,299
使用 gigafixel 提升这些图像以
lean up those image using gigafixel to

609
00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:47,659
提高分辨率然后查看
improve the resolution and then look at

610
00:29:47,659 --> 00:29:49,860
实际的
the actual

611
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:50,880
um
um

612
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,100
图像本身并在稳定扩散中改进它们
image themselves and improve them in

613
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:56,899
如果它们不够
stable diffusion if they are not

614
00:29:56,899 --> 00:29:58,620
好
good enough

615
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:01,440
所以我认为现在我们有一个很好的
so I think right now we have a good

616
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,919
起点所有 实际图像看起来
starting point all the actual image look

617
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:08,880
可用，它们有不同的风格，
usable they are kind of different styles

618
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,440
不同的背景，不同的
different background different

619
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,360
个性，其中
personalities

620
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,340
and

621
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,620
一个仍然困扰着我，
that one is still bugging me right that

622
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:19,740
一个软到某种程度，我不
one is soft to a point where I don't

623
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:21,419
知道它会对我们将保留的模型产生什么影响
know how it's going to have an impact on

624
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:23,460
the model we'll keep it

625
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:26,399
因为我又想，有时候
because like again I guess sometimes it

626
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,500
如果其中一个
doesn't really matter if one of them is

627
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,200
不好，你显然想要追求完美并不重要，
bad you want to aim for Perfection

628
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,240
但有时你就是
obviously but sometimes you just can't

629
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,419
做不到，这个有一些我
get it this one has something I don't

630
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:38,880
不太喜欢的东西，让我们重新运行它 再次只是
quite like about it let's rerun it again

631
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,580
为了
just for the sake of

632
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:44,279
尝试改进，让我们在这里重新运行它
trying to improve things let's rerun it

633
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:47,240
in here

634
00:30:48,899 --> 00:30:51,000
是的，看起来很合适所以
yeah that looks like in good fit so

635
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,720
让我们重新运行剪辑审讯是的，
let's rerun the clip interrogate

636
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,640
那个图像有些东西
yeah there's something about that image

637
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:01,100
不太适合我，
that doesn't quite fit well with me

638
00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:11,399
如果是空气，你就去吧 有点
you go if it's the air that kind of are

639
00:31:11,399 --> 00:31:14,640
吵，或者有些地方不对劲，
sort of noisy or

640
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,580
there's something that just doesn't sit

641
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,820
right

642
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:28,440
所以这个看起来确实有所改进，
so this one looks improved definitely

643
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,399
看起来像是
looking like

644
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:34,440
稍微
slightly

645
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,860
好一点的版本，也许我需要改变
better version maybe I need to change

646
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,960
这个裁剪并调整大小，这样它就不会
this crop and resize so it doesn't maybe

647
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,899
像它一样被压扁了
squash squish it a little bit like it

648
00:31:42,899 --> 00:31:43,799
做到
did

649
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:46,200
了，也许我应该将强度降低
and maybe I should reduce the strength

650
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:51,440
到 20。让我们再重新运行一次
to 20. and let's rerun it one more time

651
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,659
好吧，
okay

652
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:09,419
所以我认为这很好，让我们
so I think that's pretty good let's keep

653
00:32:09,419 --> 00:32:10,260
that

654
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:13,260
保留它，让我们把它分解
let's break this here

655
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,299
成
into the

656
00:32:15,299 --> 00:32:18,480
图像，让我们删除重复项，
image and let's delete the duplicate

657
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,360
所以现在我认为我们可以移动了 进入
so now I think we're good to move on to

658
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,700
下一阶段，我们需要为
the next stage which is we need to

659
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:26,100
这些图像添加说明，我们需要添加一些
caption those image we need to add some

660
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,760
说明，这样我们就可以教
captioning so that we can teach

661
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:32,520
或训练 Laura 呃关于这个
uh or train the Laura uh about the

662
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,620
主题，而不是
subject and not about things that are

663
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:37,740
图像中不重要的东西，所以
not important within the image so what

指定任何东西 因为如果我们这样做那么

因为我不希望它专注于
because I don't want it to focus on

811
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:15,060
那些衣服，所以通过提供
those clothing so by giving information

812
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:17,640
